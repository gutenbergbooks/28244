<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">These</span> stories, mademoiselle, as your intuition tells
you, are for old-fashioned young people only; and
should be read in the Golden Future, some snowy
evening by the fire after a home dinner &agrave; deux. Your
predestined husband, mademoiselle, is to extend his
god-like figure upon a sofa, with an ash-tray convenient.
You are to do the reading, curled up in
the big velvet wing-chair, with the lamp at your left
elbow and the fender under your pretty feet. As for
me, I shall venture to smile at you now and then
from the printed page&mdash;but with discretion, mademoiselle,
not inconveniencing your party &agrave; deux. For,
to be rid of me, you have merely to close this book.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year had been, as everybody knows,
a momentous and sinister year for the
masculine sex; marriages and births
in the United States alone had fallen off nearly
eighty per cent.; the establishment of Suffragette
Unions in every city, town, and village of the
country, their obedience to the dictation of the
Central National Female Franchise Federation;
the financial distress of the florists, caterers,
milliners and modistes incident to the almost
total suspension of social functions throughout
the great cities of the land, threatened eventually
to paralyse the nation's business.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
Clergymen were in a pitiable condition for lack
of fees and teas; the marriage license bureau was
open only Mondays and Saturdays; the social
columns of the newspapers were abolished. All
over the Union young men were finding time hanging
heavy on their hands after business hours
because there was little to do now that every town
had its Franchise Clubs magnificently fitted with
every requisite that a rapidly advancing sex could
possibly demand.</p>

<p>The pressure upon the men of the Republic
was becoming tremendous; but, as everybody
knows, they held out with a courage worthy, perhaps,
of a better cause, and women were still denied
the franchise in the face of impending
national disaster.</p>

<p>But the Central Federation of Amalgamated
Females was to deliver a more deadly blow at man
than any yet attempted, a blow that for cruelty
and audacity remains unparalleled in the annals
of that restless sex.</p>

<p>As everybody now knows, this terrible policy
was to be inaugurated in secret; a trial was to be
made of the idea in New York State; neither the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
state nor federal governments had the faintest suspicion
of what impended; not a single newspaper
had any inkling.</p>

<p>Even Augustus Melnor, owner and editor of
that greatest of New York daily newspapers,
the <i>Morning Star</i>, continued to pay overwhelming
attention to his personal appearance, confident
that the great feminine revolt was on its last
shapely legs, and that once more womankind would
be kind to any kind of mankind, and flirt and
frivol and marry, and provide progeny, and rock
the cradle as in the good old days of yore.</p>

<p>So it happened one raw, windy day in May, Mr.
Melnor entered his private office in the huge <i>Morning
Star</i> building, in an unusually cheerful frame
of mind and sent for the city editor, Mr. Trinkle.</p>

<p>"An exceedingly pretty girl smiled at me on my
way down town, Trinkle," he said exultantly.
"That begins to look as though the backbone of
this suffragette strike was broken. What?"</p>

<p>"You've got a dent in your derby; it may have
been that," said Mr. Trinkle.</p>

<p>Mr. Melnor hastily removed his hat and
punched out the dent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
"I'm not so sure it was that," he said, flushing
up.</p>

<p>Mr. Trinkle gazed gloomily out of the window.</p>

<p>For an hour they talked business; then Mr.
Melnor was ready to go.</p>

<p>"How are my nephews getting on?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Something rotten," replied Mr. Trinkle truthfully.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with 'em?"</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;except a talent for business."</p>

<p>"You mean to say they exhibit no aptitude?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>Mr. Melnor seized his overcoat from the hook.</p>

<p>Mr. Trinkle offered to hold it for him. The
offer irritated the wealthy owner of the <i>Star</i>, who
suspected that the city editor meant to intimate
that he, Mr. Melnor, was too old to get into his
own overcoat without assistance.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" he said ungratefully. He fussed
at the carnation in his buttonhole, picked up his
doggy walking stick, glanced over his carefully
pressed trousers and light coloured spats, strolled
across to the mirror, and leisurely drew on his
new gloves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
"Mr. Trinkle," he began more complacently,
"what I want you to always bear in mind is that
my pup nephews require a thorough grilling! I
want you to bully 'em! Suppress 'em! Squelch,
nag, worry, sit on 'em!"</p>

<p>"I have," said the city editor with satisfaction.
"They loathe me."</p>

<p>"Do it some more, then! I won't permit any
nepotism in this office! If you don't keep after
'em they'll turn into little beastly journalists instead
of into decent, self-respecting newspaper
men! Have either of my nephews attempted to
write any more poetry for the Saturday supplement?"</p>

<p>"Young Sayre got away with some verses."</p>

<p>"Wha' d'ye do with 'em?" growled Mr. Melnor.</p>

<p>"Printed 'em."</p>

<p>"<i>Printed</i> them! Are&mdash;you&mdash;craz-y?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry. Sayre got no signature out of
me."</p>

<p>"But <i>why</i> did you print?"</p>

<p>"Because those verses were too devilish good
to lose. You must have read them. It was that
poem <i>Amourette</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
"Did <i>he</i> do <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and the entire sentimental press of the
country is now copying it without credit."</p>

<p>"My nephew wrote <i>Amourette</i>?" repeated Mr.
Melnor with mingled emotions.</p>

<p>"He sure did. That poem seemed to deal a
direct blow at this suffragette strike. Several
women subscribers sent in mash notes. I
had a mind to take advantage of one or two myself."</p>

<p>Pride and duty contended in the breast of Augustus
Melnor; duty won.</p>

<p>"That's what I told you!" he snapped; "those
pups will begin to write for the magazines if you
don't look out!"</p>

<p>"Well <i>I</i> tell <i>you</i> that they've no nose for news&mdash;no
real instinct&mdash;and they might as well write
for the backs of the magazines."</p>

<p>"They've got to acquire news instinct! Bang
it into 'em, Trinkle! Rub their noses in it! I'll
have those pups understand that if ever they expect
to see any inheritance from me they'll have
to prepare themselves to step into my shoes!
They'll have to know the whole business&mdash;from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
window-washer to desk!&mdash;and they've got to like
it, too&mdash;every bit of it! You keep 'em at it if
it kills 'em, Trinkle. Understand?"</p>

<p>"It'll kill more than those gifted young literary
gentlemen," said Trinkle darkly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"It will kill a few dozen good stories. We're
going to murder a big one now. But it's your
funeral."</p>

<p>"That Adirondack story?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. It's as good as dead."</p>

<p>"Trinkle! Listen to me. How are we going
to make men of those pups if we don't rouse their
pride? I tell you a man grows to meet the opportunity.
The bigger the opportunity the bigger
he grows&mdash;or he blows up! Put those boys up
against the biggest job of the year and it's worth
five years' liberal education to them. That's my
policy. Isn't it a good one?"</p>

<p>Mr. Trinkle said: "It's your paper. <i>I</i> don't
give a damn."</p>

<p>Mr. Melnor glared at him.</p>

<p>"You do what I tell you," he growled. "You
start in and slam 'em around the way they say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
Belasco slammed Leslie Carter! I'll have no nepotism
here!"</p>

<p>He went out by a private entrance, walking
with the jaunty energy that characterised him.
Mr. Trinkle looked after him. "Talk of nepotism!"
he muttered, then struck the desk savagely.</p>

<p>To the overzealous young man who came in
with an exuberant step he snarled:</p>

<p>"Showemin! And don't you go volplaning
around this office or I'll destroy you!"</p>

<p>A moment afterward the youthful nephews of
the great Mr. Melnor appeared. They closed and
locked the door behind them as they were tersely
bidden, then stood in a row, politely and attentively
receptive&mdash;well-bred, pleasant-faced, expensive-looking
young fellows, typical of the metropolis.
Mr. Trinkle eyed them with disfavour.</p>

<p>"So at last you're ready to start, eh?" he rasped
out. "I thought perhaps you'd gone to Newport
for the summer to think it over. You are ready,
are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we hope to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, dammit! 'yes' is enough! Cut out the
'we hope to'! And try not to look at me patiently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
Mr. Sayre. I don't want anybody to be patient
with me. I dislike it. I prefer to incite impatience
in people. Impatience is a form of energy.
I like energy! Energy is important in this business.
The main thing is to get a move on; and
then, first you know, you'll begin to hustle. Try
it for a change."</p>

<p>He continued to inspect them gloomily for a
few moments; then:</p>

<p>"To successfully cover this story," he continued,
"you both <i>ought</i> to be expert woodsmen,
thoroughly inured to hardship, conversant with
woodcraft and nature. Are you?"</p>

<p>"We've been reading up," began Langdon confidently;
"we have a dozen pocket volumes to take
into the woods with us."</p>

<p>"Haven't I already warned you that every ounce
of superfluous luggage will weigh a ton in the
woods?" interrupted the city editor scornfully.
"Are you two youthful guys under the impression
that you can stroll through the wilderness
loaded down with a five-foot shelf of assorted
junk?"</p>

<p>"Sayre arranged that," said Langdon. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
has invented a wonderful system, Mr. Trinkle.
You know that thin, white stuff, which resembles
sheets of paper, that they give goldfish to eat.
Well, Sayre and I tasted it; and it wasn't very
bad; so we had them make up twelve thousand
sheets of it, flavoured with vanilla, and then we
got Dribble &amp; Co., the publishers, to print one
set of their Nature Library on the sheets and
bind 'em up in edible cassava covers. As soon
as we thoroughly master a volume we can masticate
it, pages, binding, everything. William,
show Mr. Trinkle your note-book," he added,
turning to Sayre, who hastily produced a pad and
displayed it with pardonable pride.</p>

<p>"Made entirely of fish food, sugar, pemmican,
and cassava," he said modestly. "Takes pencil,
ink, stylograph, indelible pencil, crayon, chalk&mdash;"</p>

<p>The city editor regarded the two young men and
then the edible pad in amazement.</p>

<p>"What?" he barked. "Say it again!"</p>

<p>"It's made of perfectly good fish-wafer, Mr.
Trinkle. We had it analysed by Professor
Smawl, and he says it is mildly nutritious. So
we added other ingredients&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
"You mean to say that this pad is fit to
eat?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Langdon. "Bite into it, William,
and show him."</p>

<p>Sayre bit out a page from the pad and began
to masticate it. The city editor regarded him
with intense hostility.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he said. "I haven't any further
suggestions to offer. Your uncle has picked
you for the job. But it's my private opinion
that here is where you make good or hunt another
outlet for your genius&mdash;even if your uncle
does own the <i>Star</i>."</p>

<p>Then he rose and laid his hands on their shoulders:</p>

<p>"It's a wild and desolate region," he said, with
an irony they did not immediately perceive; "nothing
but woods and rocks and air and earth and
mountains and madly rushing torrents and weird,
silent lakes&mdash;nothing but trails, macadam roads,
and sign-posts and hotels and camps and tourists,
and telephones. If you find yourself in any very
terrible solitudes, abandon everything and make
for the nearest fashionable five-dollar-a-day igloo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
It may be almost a mile away, but try to reach
it, and God bless you."</p>

<p>As the dawning suspicion that they were being
trifled with became an embarrassed certainty, the
city editor's grim visage cracked into a grimmer
grin.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't think that you young gentlemen are
cut out for a newspaper career, but <i>you</i> do, and
others higher up say to let you try it. So you're
going in to find at least one of those four men,
dead or alive. The police haven't been able to
find them, but you will, of course. The game-wardens,
fire-wardens, guides, constables, farmers,
lumbermen, sheriffs, can't discover hair or hide
of them; but no doubt you can. The wild and
dismal state forest is now full of detectives, amateur
and professional; it's full of hotel keepers,
trout fishermen, and private camps which are
provided with elevators, electric light, squash
courts, modern plumbing, and footmen in knee-breeches;
and all of these dinky ginks are hunting
for four young and wealthy men who have,
at regular intervals of one week each, suddenly
and completely disappeared from the face of na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>ture
and the awful solitudes of the Adirondacks.
I take it for granted that you have the necessary
data concerning their several and respective vanishings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Langdon, who was becoming
redder and redder under the bland flow of the
Desk's irony.</p>

<p>"Suppose you run over the main points before
you dash recklessly out into the woods via Broadway."</p>

<p>"William," said Langdon with boyish dignity,
"would you be kind enough to run over your notes
for Mr. Trinkle?"</p>

<p>"It will afford me much pleasure to do so,"
replied Sayre, also very red and dignified.</p>

<p>Out of his pocket he drew what appeared to
be an attenuated ham sandwich. Opening it with
a slight smile of triumph, as Mr. Trinkle's eyes
protruded, he turned a page of fish-wafer paper
and read aloud the pencilled memoranda:</p>

<p class="tr">"May 1st, 1910.</p>

<p>"Reginald Willett, a wealthy amateur, author
of <i>Rough Life Photography</i>, <i>Snapshots at Trees</i>,
<i>Hunting the Wild Bat with the Camera</i>, etc.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
etc., left his summer camp on the Gilded Dome,
taking with him his kodak for the purpose of
securing photographs of the wilder flowers of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>"He never returned. His butler and second
man discovered his camera in the trail.</p>

<p>"No other trace of him has yet been discovered.
He was young, well built, handsome, and
in excellent physical condition."</p>

<p>Sayre turned the page outward so that Mr.
Trinkle could see it.</p>

<p>"Here's his photograph," he said, "and his
dimensions."</p>

<p>Mr. Trinkle nodded: "Go on," he said; and
Sayre resumed, turning the page:</p>

<p>"May 8th: James Carrick, a minor poet,
young, well built, handsome, and in excellent physical
condition, disappeared from a boat on Dingman's
Pond. The boat was found. It contained
a note-book in which was neatly written the following
graceful poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"While gliding o'er thy fair expanse</p>
<p class="ihalf">And gazing at the shore beyond,</p>
<p class="ihalf">What simple joys the soul entrance</p>
<p class="ihalf">Evoked by rowing on Dingman's Pond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span></p>
<p class="ihalf">The joy I here have found shall be</p>
<p class="ihalf">Dear to my heart till life forsake,</p>
<p class="ihalf">And often shall I think of thee,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Thou mildly beauteous Dingman's Lake."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Stop!" said Mr. Trinkle, infuriated. Sayre
looked up.</p>

<p>"The poem gets the hook!" he snarled. "Go
on!"</p>

<p>"The next," continued young Sayre, referring
to his edible note-book, "is the case of De Lancy
Smith. On May 16th he left his camp, taking
with him his rod with the intention of trying for
some of the larger, wilder, and more dangerous
trout which it is feared still infest the remoter
streams of the State forest.</p>

<p>"His luncheon, consisting of truffled pat&eacute;s and
champagne, was found by a searching party, but
De Lancy Smith has never again been seen or
heard of. He was young, well built, handsome,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In excellent physical condition!" snapped Mr.
Trinkle. "That's the third Adonis you've described.
Quit it!"</p>

<p>"But that is the exact description of those
three young men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
"Every one of 'em?"</p>

<p>"Every one. They all seem to have been exceptionally
handsome and healthy."</p>

<p>"Well, does that suggest any clue to you?
Think! Use your mind. Do you see any clue?"</p>

<p>"In what?"</p>

<p>"In the probably similar fate of so much masculine
beauty?"</p>

<p>The young men looked at him, perplexed, silent.</p>

<p>Mr. Trinkle waved his hands in desperation.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" he shouted. "Doesn't it strike you
as odd that every one of them so far has been
Gibsonian perfection itself? Doesn't that seem
funny? Doesn't it suggest some connection with
the present Franchise strike?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> odd," said Langdon, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You notice," bellowed Mr. Trinkle, "that no
young man disappears who isn't a physical Adonis,
do you? No thin-shanked, stoop-shouldered,
scant-haired highbrow has yet vanished. You
notice that, don't you, Sayre? Open your mouth
and speak! Say anything! Say pip! if you like&mdash;only
say <i>something</i>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
The young man nodded, bewildered, and his
mouth remained open.</p>

<p>"All right, all right&mdash;as long as you <i>do</i> notice
it," yelled the city editor, "it looks safe for you;
I guess <i>you</i> both will come back, all right&mdash;in
case any of these suffragettes have become desperate
and have started kidnapping operations."</p>

<p>Langdon was rather thin; he glanced sideways
at Sayre, who wore glasses and whose locks were
prematurely scant.</p>

<p>"Go on, William," he said, with a crisp precision
of diction which betrayed irritation and
Harvard.</p>

<p>Sayre examined his notes, and presently read
from them:</p>

<p>"The fourth and last victim of the Adirondack
wilderness disappeared very recently&mdash;May 24th.
His name was Alphonso W. Green, a wealthy
amateur artist. When last seen he was followed
by his valet, who carried a white umbrella, a folding
stool, a box of colours, and several canvases.
After luncheon the valet went back to the Gilded
Dome Hotel to fetch some cigarettes. When he
returned to where he had left his master painting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
a picture of something, which he thinks was a
tree, but which may have been cows in bathing,
Mr. Green had vanished. . . . Hum&mdash;hum!&mdash;ahem!
He was young, well built, handsome,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kill it!" thundered the city editor, purple with
passion.</p>

<p>"But it's the official descrip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it! I won't! I can't! How
the devil can a whole bunch of perfect Apollos
disappear that way? There are not four such
men in this State, anyway&mdash;outside of fiction and
the stage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm only reading you the official&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Trinkle gulped; the chewing muscles worked
in his cheeks, then calmness came, and his low
and anxiously lined brow cleared.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Show me, that's all I
ask. Go ahead and find just one of these disappearing
Apollos. That's all I ask."</p>

<p>He shook an inky finger at them impressively,
timing its wagging to his parting admonition:</p>

<p>"We want two things, do you understand? We
want a story, and we want to print it before any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
other paper. Never mind reporting progress and
the natural scenery; never mind telegraphing the
condition of the local colour or the dialect of
northern New York, or your adventures with nature,
or how you went up against big game, or
any other kind of game. I don't want to hear
from you until you've got something to say. All
you're to do is to prowl and mouse and slink and
lurk and hunt and snoop and explore those woods
until you find one or more of these Adonises; and
then get the story to us by chain-lightning, if,"
he added indifferently, "it breaks both your silly
necks to do it."</p>

<p>They passed out with calm dignity, saying
"Good-bye, sir," in haughtily modulated voices.</p>

<p>As they closed the door they heard him grunt
a parting injury.</p>

<p>"What an animal!" observed Sayre. "If it
wasn't for the glory of being on the <i>N. Y.
Star</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Langdon, "it's a great paper; besides,
we've got to&mdash;if we want to remain next to
Uncle Augustus."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a great newspaper; for ethical authority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
its editorials might be compared only to the
<i>Herald's</i>; for disinterested principle the <i>Sun</i> alone
could compare with it; it had all the lively enterprise
and virile, restless energy of the <i>Tribune</i>;
all the gay, inconsequent, and frothy sparkle of
the <i>Evening Post</i>; all the risky popularity of the
<i>Outlook</i>. It was a very, very great New York
daily. What on earth has become of it!</p>

<h2>II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Langdon</span>, very greasy with fly ointment,
very sleepy from a mosquitoful night,
squatted cross-legged by the camp fire,
nodding drowsily. Sayre fought off mosquitoes
with one grimy hand; with the other he turned
flapjacks on the blade of his hunting-knife. All
around them lay the desolate Adirondack wilderness.
The wire fence of a game preserve obstructed
their advance. It was almost three-quarters
of a mile to the nearest hotel. Here and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
there in the forest immense boulders reared their
prehistoric bulk. Many bore the inscription:
"Votes for Women!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I <i>did</i> see her," repeated Sayre, setting
the coffee-pot on the ashes and inspecting
the frying pork.</p>

<p>"The chances are," yawned Langdon, rousing
himself and feebly sucking at his empty pipe,
"that you fell asleep waiting for a bite&mdash;as I did
just now. Now I've got my bite and I'm awake.
It was a horse-fly. Aren't those flapjacks ready?"</p>

<p>"If you're so hungry, help yourself to a ream
of fish-wafer," snapped Sayre. "I'm not a Hindoo
god, so I can't cook everything at once."</p>

<p>Langdon waked up still more.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," he said fiercely, "that I'd
rather gnaw circles in a daisy field than eat any
more of your accursed fish-wafer. Do you realise
that I've already consumed six entire pads, one
ledger, and two note-books?"</p>

<p>Sayre struck frantically at a mosquito.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, "whether it might help
matters to fry it?"</p>

<p>"That mosquito?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
"No, you idiot! A fish-wafer."</p>

<p>"You'd better get busy and fry a few trout."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"In some of these devilish brooks. It's up to
you to catch a few."</p>

<p>"Didn't I try?" demanded Sayre; "didn't I fish
all the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"All I know about it is that you came back
here last night with a farthest north story and
no fish. You're an explorer, all right."</p>

<p>"Look here, Curtis! Don't you believe I saw
her?"</p>

<p>"Sure. When I fall asleep I sometimes see the
same kind&mdash;all winners, too."</p>

<p>"I was <i>not</i> asleep!"</p>

<p>"You said yourself that you were dead tired of
waiting for a trout to become peevish and bite."</p>

<p>"I was. But I didn't fall asleep. I did see
that girl. I watched her for several minutes. . . .
Breakfast's ready."</p>

<p>Langdon looked mournfully at the flapjacks.
He picked up one which was only half scorched,
buttered it, poured himself a cup of sickly coffee,
and began to eat with an effort.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
"You say," he began, "that you first noticed
her when you were talking out loud to yourself
to keep yourself awake?"</p>

<p>"While waiting for a trout to bite," said Sayre,
swallowing a lump of food violently. "I was amusing
myself by repeating aloud my poem, <i>Amourette</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Where is the girl of yesterday?</p>
<p class="ihalf">The kind that snuggled up?</p>
<p class="ihalf">In vain I walk along Broadway&mdash;</p>
<p class="ihalf">Where is the girl of yesterday,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Whose pretty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"All right! Go on with the facts!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I was repeating," said Sayre,
tartly, "and it's as good verse as you can do!"</p>

<p>Langdon bit into another flapjack with resignation.
Sayre swallowed a cup of coffee, dodging
an immersed June-beetle.</p>

<p>"I was just repeating that poem aloud," he
said, shuddering. "The woods were very still&mdash;except
for the flies and mosquitoes; sunlight lay
warm and golden on the mossy tree-trunks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it. You're not on space rates."</p>

<p>"I was trying to give you a picture of the
scene&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
"You did; the local colour about the mosquitoes
convinced me. Go on about the girl."</p>

<p>An obstinate expression hardened Sayre's face;
the breeze stirred a lock on his handsome but
prematurely bald forehead; he gazed menacingly
at his companion through his gold pince-nez.</p>

<p>"I'll blue-pencil my own stuff," he said. "If
you want to hear how it happened you'll listen to
the literary part, too."</p>

<p>"Go on, then," said Langdon, sullenly.</p>

<p>"I will. . . . The sunlight fell softly upon
the trees of the ancient wood; bosky depths cast
velvety shadows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is a bosky depth? What <i>is</i> boskiness?
By heaven, I've waited years to ask; and
now's my chance? You tell me what 'bosky' is,
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you want to hear about that girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you fill your face full of flapjack and
shut up."</p>

<p>Langdon bit rabidly at a flapjack and beat the
earth with his heels.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
"The stream," continued Sayre, "purled." He
coldly watched the literary effect upon Langdon,
then went on:</p>

<p>"Now, there's enough descriptive colour to give
you a proper mental picture. If you had left
me alone I'd have finished it ten minutes ago.
The rest moves with accelerated rhythm. It begins
with the cracking of a stick in the forest.
Hark! A sharp crack is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Every bum novel begins that way."</p>

<p>"Well, the real thing did, too! And it startled
me. How did I know what it might have been?
It might have been a bear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or a cow."</p>

<p>"You talk," said Sayre angrily, "like William
Dean Howells! Haven't you <i>any</i> romance in
you?"</p>

<p>"Not what <i>you</i> call romance. Pass the flapjacks."</p>

<p>Sayre passed them.</p>

<p>"My attention," he said, "instantly became
riveted upon the bushes. I strove to pierce them
with a piercing glance. Suddenly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure! 'Suddenly' always comes next."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
"Suddenly the thicket stirred; the leaves were
stealthily parted; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A naked savage in full war paint&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naked nothing! A young girl in full war
paint and a perfectly fitting gown stepped noiselessly
out."</p>

<p>"Out of what? you gink!"</p>

<p>"The bushes, dammit! She held in her hand
a curious contrivance which I could not absolutely
identify. It might have been a hammock; it
might have been a fish-net."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was a combination," suggested
Langdon cheerfully. "Good idea; she to help
you catch a trout; you to help her sit in the hammock;
afterward&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sayre, absorbed in retrospection, squatted beside
the fire, a burnt flapjack suspended below
his lips, which were slightly touched with a tenderly
reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>"What are you smirking about <i>now</i>?" demanded
Langdon.</p>

<p>"She was <i>such</i> a pretty girl," mused Sayre,
dreamily.</p>

<p>"Did you sit in the hammock with her?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
"No, I didn't. I'm not sure it was a hammock.
I don't know what it was. She remained in sight
only a moment."</p>

<p>"Didn't you speak to her?"</p>

<p>"No. . . . We just looked. She looked at me;
I gazed at her. She was so unusually pretty, Curtis;
and her grave, grey eyes seemed to meet mine
and melt deep into me. Somehow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In plainer terms," suggested Langdon, "she
gave you the eye. What?"</p>

<p>"That's a peculiarly coarse observation."</p>

<p>"Then tell it your own way."</p>

<p>"I will. The sunlight fell softly upon the trees
of the ancient wood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woodn't that bark you!" shouted Langdon,
furious. "Go on with the dolly dialogue or I'll
punch your head, you third-rate best seller!"</p>

<p>"But there was no dialogue, Curt. It began
and ended in a duet of silence," he added sentimentally.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say anything? Didn't you try
to make a date? Aren't you going to see her
again?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I am not sure what sweet oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>cult
telepathy might have passed between us, Curtis. . . .
Somehow I believe that all is not yet
ended. . . . . Pass the pork! . . . I like to think
that somehow, some day, somewhere&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop that! You're ending it the way women
end short stories in the thirty-five-centers. What
I want to know is, why you think that your encounter
with this girl has anything to do with
our finding Reginald Willett."</p>

<p>There was a basin of warm water simmering
on the ashes; Sayre used it as a finger-bowl, dried
his hands on his shirt, lighted his pipe, and then
slowly drew from his hip pocket a flat leather
pocket-book. "Curt," he said, "I'm not selfish.
I'm perfectly willing to share glory with you.
You know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," muttered Langdon. "You're a bum
cook, but otherwise moral enough."</p>

<p>Sayre opened the pocket-book and produced a
photograph.</p>

<p>"Everybody who is searching for Willett," he
said, "examined the few clues he left. Like hundreds
of others, you and I, when we first entered
these woods, went to his camp on Gilded Dome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
prowled all over it, and examined the camera which
had been picked up in the trail, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"We did. It was a sad scene&mdash;his distracted
old father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"H'm! Did you see his distracted old father,
Curt?"</p>

<p>"I? No, of course not. Like everybody else,
I respected the grief of that aged and stricken
gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> didn't."</p>

<p>"Hey? Why, you yellow dingo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Curt, as I was snooping about the Italian Garden
I happened to glance up at the mansion&mdash;I
mean the camp&mdash;and I saw by the window a rather
jolly old buck with a waxed moustache and a
monocle, smoking a good cigar and perusing his
after-breakfast newspaper. A gardener told me
that this tranquil old bird was Willett Senior, who
had arrived the evening before from Europe via
New York. So I went straight into that house
and I disregarded the butler, second man, valet,
and seven assorted servants; and Mr. Willett Senior
heard the noise and came to the dining-room
door. 'Well, what the devil's the matter?' he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
I said: 'I only want to ask you one question,
sir. Why are you not in a state of terrible mental
agitation over the tragic disappearance of
your son?'</p>

<p>"'Because,' he replied, coolly, 'I know my son,
Reginald. If the newspapers and the public
will let him alone he'll come back when he gets
ready.'</p>

<p>"'Are you not alarmed?'</p>

<p>"'Not in the least.'</p>

<p>"'Then why did you return from Europe and
hasten up here?'</p>

<p>"'Too many newspaper men hanging around.'
He glanced insultingly at the silver.</p>

<p>"I let that go. 'Mr. Willett,' I said, 'they
found your son's camera on the trail. Your butler
exhibits it to the police and reporters and tells
them a glib story. He told it to me, also. But
what I want to know is, why nobody has thought
of developing the films.'</p>

<p>"'My butler,' said Mr. Willett, eyeing me, 'did
develop the films.'</p>

<p>"'Was there anything on them?'</p>

<p>"'Some trees.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
"'May I see them?'</p>

<p>"He scrutinised me.</p>

<p>"'After you've seen them will you take your
friend and go away and remain?' he asked wearily.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said.</p>

<p>"He walked into the breakfast room, opened a
silver box, and returned with half a dozen photographs.
The first five presented as many views
of foliage; I used a jeweller's glass on them, but
discovered nothing else."</p>

<p>"Was there anything to jar you on the sixth
photograph?" inquired Langdon, interested.</p>

<p>Sayre made an impressive gesture; he was a
trifle inclined toward the picturesque and histrionic.</p>

<p>"Curt, on the ground under a tree in the sixth
photograph lay something which, until last evening,
did not seem to me important." He paused
dramatically.</p>

<p>"Well, what was it? A bandersnatch?" asked
Langdon irritably.</p>

<p>"Examine it!"</p>

<p>Langdon took the photograph. "It looks like
a&mdash;a hammock."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
"What that girl held in her hand last night
resembled a hammock."</p>

<p>"Hey?"</p>

<p>Sayre leaned over his shoulder and laid the stem
of his pipe on the extreme edge of the photograph.</p>

<p>"If you look long enough and hard enough,"
he said, "you will just be able to make out the
vague outline of a slender human hand among the
leaves, holding the end of the hammock. See
it?"</p>

<p>Langdon looked long and steadily. Presently
he fished out a jeweller's glass, screwed it into
his eye, and looked again.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's a human hand?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"It's a slim one&mdash;a child's, or a young girl's."</p>

<p>"It is. <i>She</i> had be-u-tiful hands."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"That girl I saw last evening."</p>

<p>Langdon slowly turned and looked at Sayre.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing yet&mdash;except a million different little
romances."</p>

<p>"Of course, you'd do that anyway. But what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
scientific inference do you draw? Here's a thing
that looks like a hammock lying on the ground.
One end seems to be lifted; perhaps that <i>is</i> a
hand. Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to find out."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By&mdash;fishing," said Sayre quietly, rising and
picking up his rod.</p>

<p>"You're going back there in hopes of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In hopes."</p>

<p>After a silence Langdon said: "You say she
was unusually pretty?"</p>

<p>"Unusually."</p>

<p>"Shall I&mdash;go with you, William?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sayre coldly.</p>

<h2>III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sayre</span> had been fishing for some time with
the usual result when the slightest rustle of
foliage caught his ear. He looked up.
She was standing directly behind him.</p>

<p>He got to his feet immediately and pulled off
his cap. That was too bad; he was better looking
with it on his head.</p>

<p>"I wondered whether you'd come again," he
said, so simply and naturally that the girl, whose
grey eyes had become intent on his scanty hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
with a surprised and pained expression, looked
directly into his smiling and agreeable face.</p>

<p>"Did you come to fish this pool?" he asked.
"You are very welcome to. <i>I</i> can't catch anything."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that I am out fishing?"
she asked in a curiously clear, still voice&mdash;very
sweet and young&mdash;but a voice that seemed to grow
out of the silence instead of to interrupt it.</p>

<p>"You are fishing, are you not? or at least you
came here to fish last evening?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"You had a net."</p>

<p>He expected her to say that it was a hammock
which she was trailing through the woods in search
of two convenient saplings on which to hang it.</p>

<p>She said: "Yes, it was a net."</p>

<p>"Did my being here drive you away from your
favourite pool?"</p>

<p>She looked at him candidly. "You are not a
sportsman, are you?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," he admitted, turning red. "Why?"</p>

<p>"People who take trout in nets are fined and
imprisoned."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
"Oh! But you <i>said</i> you had a net."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a fish net."</p>

<p>He waited. She offered no further explanation.
Sometimes she looked at him, rather gravely,
he thought; sometimes she looked at the stream.
There was not the slightest hint of embarrassment
in her manner as she stood there&mdash;a straight, tall,
young thing, grey-eyed, red-lipped, slim, with that
fresh slender smoothness of youth; clad in grey
wool, hatless, thick burnished hair rippling into
a heavy knot at the nape of the whitest neck he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>The stiller she stood, apparently wrapped in
serious inward contemplation, the stiller he remained,
as though the spell of her serene self-absorption
consigned him to silence. Once he
ventured, stealthily, to smack a mosquito, but at
the echoing whack there was, in her slowly turned
face, the calm surprise of a disturbed goddess;
and he felt like saying "excuse me."</p>

<p>"Do they bite you?" she asked, lifting her divine
eyebrows a trifle.</p>

<p>"Bite me! Good heavens, don't they bite you?
But I don't suppose they dare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
"What?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean 'dare' exactly," he tried to explain,
feeling his ears turning a fiery red, and
wondering why on earth he should have made
such a foolish remark.</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;nothing. I don't know. I say things and&mdash;and
sometimes," he added in a burst of confidence,
"they don't seem to <i>mean</i> anything at
all." To himself he groaned through ground
teeth: "What an ass I am. What on earth is
the matter with me?"</p>

<p>She considered him in silence, candidly; and
redder and redder grew his ears as he saw that
she was quietly inspecting him from head to foot
with an interest perfectly unembarrassed, innocently
intent upon her inspection.</p>

<p>Then, having finished him down to his feet, she
lifted her eyes, caught his, looked a moment
straight into them, then sighed a little.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "I ought not to have
come here again."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"There's no use in my telling you. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
no use in my coming. Oh, I realise that perfectly
well now. And I think I'd better go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lingered a moment, glanced at the stream
running gold in the afternoon light, then turned
away, bidding him good-bye in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Are you g-going?" he blurted out, not knowing
exactly what he was saying.</p>

<p>She moved on in silence. He looked after her.
A perfectly illogical feeling of despair overwhelmed
him.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't go away!" he said.</p>

<p>She moved on a pace, another, more slowly,
hesitated, halted, leisurely looked back over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;I said&mdash;I said&mdash;&mdash;" but he began to
stammer fearfully and could get no farther.</p>

<p>Perhaps she thought he was threatened with
some kind of seizure; anyway, something about
him apparently interested her enough to slowly retrace
her steps.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mr. Sayre?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, <i>that's</i> funny!" he said; "you know my
name?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
"Yes, I know your name."</p>

<p>"Could&mdash;would&mdash;should&mdash;might&mdash;&mdash;" he could
get no farther.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"M-might I&mdash;would it be&mdash;could you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you trying to ask me what is <i>my</i> name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "did you think I was reciting
a lesson in grammar?"</p>

<p>Suddenly the rare smile played delicately along
the edges of her upcurled mouth.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I knew you were embarrassed.
It wasn't nice of me. But," and her face grew
grave, "there is no use in my telling you my
name."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because we shall not meet again."</p>

<p>"Won't you ever let me&mdash;give me a chance&mdash;because&mdash;you
know, somehow&mdash;seeing you yesterday&mdash;and
to-day&mdash;this way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. <i>I</i> came back, too," she said seriously.</p>

<p>A strange, inexplicable tingling pervaded
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
"You came&mdash;came&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I should not have done it, because I
saw you perfectly plainly yesterday. But&mdash;somehow
I hoped&mdash;somehow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"That there had been a mistake."</p>

<p>"You thought you knew me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I knew perfectly well I had never
before seen you. That made no difference. It
wasn't that. But I thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;I had made
a mistake. In fact," she said, with a slight effort,
"I was dishonest with myself. I knew all
the time that it was useless. And as soon as I
saw you with your cap off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"W-what!" he faltered.</p>

<p>A slight blush, perfectly distinct in her creamy
skin, grew, then waned.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said. "Of course, you do
not understand what I am saying; and I can not
explain. . . . And I think I had&mdash;better&mdash;go."</p>

<p>"Please don't."</p>

<p>"That is an added reason for my going."</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
"Your saying 'please don't.'"</p>

<p>He looked at her, bewildered, and slowly passed
his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Somehow," he said, "this is all like magic to
me. Here in the wilderness I hear a stick
crack&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I meant you to hear it. I could have moved
without a sound."</p>

<p>"And, looking up, I see the most beautif&mdash;I
see&mdash;you. Then I dream of you."</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Every moment&mdash;between mosquitoes! And
then to-day I returned, hoping."</p>

<p>She lost a trifle of her colour.</p>

<p>"Hoping&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"T-t-to s-s-see you," he stammered.</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> go," she said under her breath, almost
hurriedly; "this must stop <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>"Won't you&mdash;can't you&mdash;couldn't I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;Mr. Sayre."</p>

<p>He said: "I've simply got to see you again.
I know what I'm asking&mdash;saying&mdash;hoping&mdash;wishing&mdash;isn't
usual&mdash;conventional&mdash;advisable, b-b-but
I can't help it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
Standing there facing him she slowly shook her
head.</p>

<p>"There is no use," she said. "It is perfectly
horrid of me to have come back. I somehow was
afraid&mdash;from the expression of your face yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>She hesitated; then, lifting her grey eyes, fearlessly:</p>

<p>"Afraid that you might wish to see me again.
. . . Because I felt the same way."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," he cried, "that I&mdash;that you&mdash;that
we&mdash;Oh, Lord! I'm not eloquent, but
every faltering, stuttering, stammering, fool of a
word I <i>do</i> say means a million things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it, Mr. Sayre. I know it. I have
no business here; I <i>must</i> not remain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you go, you know I'll do some absurd thing&mdash;like
poking my head under water and holding
it there, or walking backward off that ledge. Do
you know&mdash;if you should suddenly go away now,
and if that ended it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ended&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"You know," he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
She may have known, for she stood very still,
with head lowered and downcast eyes. As for
Sayre, what common sense he possessed had gone.
The thrilling unreality of it all&mdash;the exquisite irrational,
illogical intoxication of the moment&mdash;her
beauty&mdash;the mystery of her&mdash;and of the still,
sunlit woods, had made of them both, and the
forest world around them, an enchanted dream
which he was living, every breath a rapture, every
heart-beat an excited summons from the occult.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sayre," she said, with an effort, "I shall
not tell you my name; but if you ever again should
happen to think of me, think of my name as the
name of the girl in that poem which I heard you
reciting yesterday."</p>

<p>"Amourette?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That was the name of the poem and
of the girl. You may call me Amourette&mdash;when
you are thinking of me alone by yourself."</p>

<p>"Did you like that poem?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I wrote it."</p>

<p>"You!" She lost a little of her colour.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I wrote it&mdash;Amourette."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
"Then&mdash;then I had better go away as fast as
I can," she murmured.</p>

<p>With an enraptured smile verging perilously
upon the infatuated, if not fatuous, he repeated
her name aloud; and she looked at him out of
soft grey eyes that seemed at once fascinated and
distressed.</p>

<p>"Please let me go," she said.</p>

<p>He was not detaining her.</p>

<p>"Won't you?" she asked, pitifully.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," said William Sayre, suddenly
invaded by an instinct that he possessed authority
in the matter. "We must talk this thing over."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there isn't any use&mdash;really, truly there
isn't! Won't you believe me?"</p>

<p>"No," he said as honestly as he could through
the humming exaltation that sang in him until, to
himself, he sounded like a beehive.</p>

<p>There was a fallen log all over moss behind
her.</p>

<p>"We ought to be seated to properly consider
this matter," he said.</p>

<p>"I must not think of it! I must go instantly."</p>

<p>When they were seated, and he had nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
twisted his head off trying to meet her downcast
eyes, he resumed a normal and less parrot-like
posture, and folded his arms portentously.</p>

<p>"To begin," he said, "I came here fishing. I
heard a stick crack&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> was my fault. It was all my fault. I
don't know how I ever came to do it. I never did
such a thing in my life. We merely heard that
you and Mr. Langdon were in the woods&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> heard?"</p>

<p>"We. Never mind the others. I'll say that <i>I</i>
heard you were here. And&mdash;and I took my&mdash;my
net and came to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"To&mdash;investigate."</p>

<p>"Investigate what? <i>Me</i>?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes. I can't explain. But I came, honestly,
naturally, unsuspiciously. And as soon as I saw
you I was quite sure that you were not what&mdash;what
certain people wanted, even if you were the
author of <i>Amourette</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-21.jpg"><img src="./images/ill-21_th.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">"'To begin,' he said, 'I came here fishing.'"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> was not what <i>you</i> wanted?" he repeated, bewildered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
"I mean that&mdash;that you were not what&mdash;what
<i>they</i> required&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They? Who are <i>they</i>? And what, in Heaven's
name, did 'they' require?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to tell you, Mr. Sayre. All I
shall say is that I knew immediately that they
didn't want <i>you</i>, because you are not up to the
University standard. And you won't understand
that. I ought to have gone quietly away. . . .
I don't know why I didn't. I was so interested
in listening to you recite, and in looking at you.
I loved your poem, <i>Amourette</i>. . . . And two
hours slipped by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You stood there in the bushes looking at <i>me</i>
for two hours, <i>and</i> listening to my poem&mdash;and
<i>liking</i> it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. . . . I don't know why. . . . And
then, somehow, without any apparent reason, I
wanted you to see <i>me</i> . . . without any apparent
reason . . . and so I stepped on a dry stick. . . .
And to-day I came back . . . without any apparent
reason. . . . I don't know what on earth
has happened to make me&mdash;make me&mdash;forget&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget what?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
"Everything&mdash;except&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except what?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with clear grey eyes, a
trifle daunted.</p>

<p>"Forget everything except that I&mdash;like you,
Mr. Sayre."</p>

<p>He said: "That is the sweetest and most fearless
thing a woman ever said. I am absurdly
happy over it."</p>

<p>She waited, looking down at her linked fingers.</p>

<p>"And," he said, "for the first time in all my
life I have cared more for what a woman has
said to me than I care for anything on earth."</p>

<p>There was a good deal of the poet in William
Sayre.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" she asked, tremulously.</p>

<p>"I mean more."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think you had better not say&mdash;more."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because of what I told you. There is no use
in your&mdash;your finding me&mdash;interesting."</p>

<p>"Are you married?" he asked, so guilelessly
that she blushed and denied it with haste.</p>

<p>His head was spinning in a sea of pink clouds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
Harps were playing somewhere; it may have been
the breeze in the pines.</p>

<p>"Amourette," he repeated in a sort of divine
daze.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;going," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Do you desire to render me miserable for
life?" he asked so seriously that at first she
scarcely realised what he had said. Then blush
and pallor came and went; she caught her breath,
looked up at him, beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Everything is wrong," she said in the ghost
of a voice. "Things are hurrying me&mdash;trying to
drive me headlong. I must go. Let me go,
now."</p>

<p>And she sat very still, and closed her eyes. A
second later she opened them.</p>

<p>"Why did you come?" she asked almost fiercely.
"There was no use in it! Why did you come into
these woods for that foolish newspaper? By this
time the Associated Press, the police, and the families
of the men you are looking for have received
letters from every one of the four missing young
men, saying that they are perfectly well and happy
and expect to return&mdash;after their honeymoons."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
Flushed, excited, beautiful in her animation,
she faced the astounded young man who stared at
her wildly through his eye-glasses.</p>

<p>After a while he managed to ask whether she
wished him to believe that these four young men
had each eloped with their soul mates.</p>

<p>She bit her lip. "To be accurate," she said in
a low voice, "somebody eloped with each one of
them."</p>

<p>"How? I don't understand!"</p>

<p>"I don't wish you to. . . . Good-bye."</p>

<p>"You mean," he demanded, incredulously, "that
four girls ran away with these four big, hulking
young men?"</p>

<p>"Practically."</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous! Besides, it's impossible!
Besides&mdash;women don't run men off like cattle
rustlers. Man is the active agent in elopements,
woman the passive agent."</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"Isn't she?"</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>He said: "Amourette, shall I illustrate what
I mean&mdash;with you as the passive agent?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
The girl bent over a little, then with a sudden
movement she dropped her head in her hands. A
moment later he saw a single tear fall between her
fingers.</p>

<p>He looked east, west, north, south, and finally
up into the sky. Seeing nobody, the silly expression
left his otherwise interesting face; a graver,
gentler light grew in his eyes. And he put one
arm around her supple waist.</p>

<p>"Something is dreadfully wrong," he said; "all
this must be explained&mdash;our strange encounter,
our speaking, our talking at cross purposes, our
candid interest in each other&mdash;the sudden, swift,
unfeigned friendship that was born the instant that
our eyes encountered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it. It <i>was</i> born. Oh, I know it. I
<i>know</i> it, and I could not help it&mdash;somehow&mdash;somehow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it was almost like&mdash;like&mdash;love at first
sight," he whispered.</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;something like it&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think it <i>was</i> love?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. . . . Do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. . . . You mustn't cry. Put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
your head down&mdash;here. You mustn't be distressed."</p>

<p>"I am, dreadfully."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be."</p>

<p>"I can't help it&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"Could you help it if you&mdash;loved me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Oh, no! It would distress me beyond
measure to&mdash;to love you. Oh, it must not be&mdash;it
must not happen to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is already happening to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Don't let it! Don't let it happen to either
of us! Please&mdash;please&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it <i>is</i> happening all the while, Amourette."</p>

<p>She drew a swift, startled sigh.</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> what it is that is happening to me, too,
Mr. Sayre?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think so."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, <i>oh</i>!" she sobbed, hiding her face closer
to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Amourette! Darling! Dea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"L-listen. Because now I've got to tell you all
about the disappearance of those perfectly horrid
young specimens of physical perfection. And after
that you will abhor me!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
"Abhor <i>you</i>! Dearest&mdash;dearest and most divine
of women!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" she sobbed. "I've got myself and you
into the most awful scrape you ever dreamed of
by falling in love with you at first sight!"</p>

<p>And she turned her face closer to his shoulder
and slipped one desperate little hand into his.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> two o'clock that afternoon Sayre
rushed into camp with his scanty hair
on end.</p>

<p>Langdon, who had been attempting to boil a
blank-book for dinner, gazed at him in consternation.</p>

<p>"What is it? Bears, William?" he asked fearfully.
"D-d-don't be f-f-frightened; I'll stand by
you."</p>

<p>"It isn't bears, you simp! I've just unearthed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
the most colossal conspiracy of the century! Curtis,
things are happening in these woods that are
incredible, abominable, horrible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> is happening?" faltered Langdon, turning
paler. "Murder?"</p>

<p>"Worse! They've got Willett and the others!
She admitted it to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey?"</p>

<p>"Willett and Carrick and the others!" shouted
Sayre, gesticulating. "They've caught 'em all!
She said so! I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They? She? Who's caught what? Who's
'they'? What it is? Who's 'she'? What are
you talking about, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Amourette told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Amourette? Who the deuce is Amourette?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Shut up! My head's spinning
like a gyroscope. All I know is that I want to
marry her and she won't let me&mdash;and I believe she
would if I had a reliable hair-restorer and wasn't
near-sighted&mdash;but she ran away and got inside
the fence and locked the gate."</p>

<p>"Are you drunk?" demanded Langdon, "or
merely frolicsome?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
"<i>I</i> don't know. I guess I am. I'm about everything
else. What do I know about anything anyway?
Nothing!"</p>

<p>He began to run around in circles; Langdon,
having seen similar symptoms in demented cats,
regarded him with growing alarm.</p>

<p>"I tell you it's an outrageous social condition
which tolerates such doings!" shouted Sayre.
"It's a perfectly monstrous state of things! Nine
handsome men out of ten are fatheads! I told
her so! I tried to point out to her&mdash;but she
wouldn't listen&mdash;she wouldn't listen!"</p>

<p>Langdon stared at him, jaw agape. Then:</p>

<p>"Quit that ghost-dancing and talk sense," he
ventured.</p>

<p>"Do you think that men are going to stand
for it?" yelled Sayre, waving his hands, "ordinary,
decent, God-fearing, everyday young men
like you and me? If this cataclysmic cult gains
ground among American women&mdash;if these exasperating
suffragettes really intend to carry out
any such programme, everybody on earth will resemble
everybody else&mdash;like those wax figures
marked 'neat,' 'imported,' and 'nobby'! And I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
told Amourette that, too; but she wouldn't listen&mdash;she
wouldn't lis&mdash;My God! <i>Why</i> am I bald?"</p>

<p>He swung his arms like a pair of flails and
advanced distractedly upon Langdon, who immediately
retreated.</p>

<p>"Come back here," he said. "I want to picture
to you the horrors that are going on in your native
land! You ought to know. You've got to
know!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, old man," quavered Langdon, keeping
a tree between them. "But don't come any
closer or I'll scream."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm nutty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all&mdash;not <i>at</i> all," said Langdon
soothingly. "Probably the wafers disagreed with
you."</p>

<p>"Curtis, wouldn't it rock any man's equilibrium
to fall head over heels in love with a girl inside
of ten minutes? I merely ask you, man to man."</p>

<p>"It sure would, dear friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then to see that divine girl almost ready
to love you in return&mdash;see it perfectly, plainly?
And have her tell you that she could learn to
care for you if your hair wasn't so thin and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
didn't wear eye-glasses? By Jinks! That was
<i>too</i> much! I'll leave it to you&mdash;<i>wasn't</i> it?"</p>

<p>Langdon swallowed hard and watched his friend
fixedly.</p>

<p>"And then," continued Sayre, grinding his
teeth, "<i>then</i> she told me about Willett!"</p>

<p>"Hey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the whole thing is knocked in the head
from a newspaper standpoint. They've all written
home. They're married&mdash;or on the point of
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"But that isn't what bothers me. What do I
care about this job, or any other job, since I've
seen the only girl on earth that I could ever stay
home nights for! And to think that she ran away
from me and I'm never to see her again because
I'm near-sighted and partly bald!"</p>

<p>He waved his arms distractedly.</p>

<p>"But, by the gods and demons!" he cried, "I'm
not going to stand for her going hunting with
that man-net! If she catches any insufferable
pup in it I'll go insane!"</p>

<p>Langdon's eyes rolled and he breathed heavily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
"Old man," he ventured, kindly, "don't you
think you'd better lie down and try to take a nice
little nap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sayre instantly chased him around the tree and
caught him.</p>

<p>"Curt," he said savagely, "get over the idea
that there's anything the matter with me mentally
except love and righteous indignation. I
<i>am</i> in love; and it hurts. I'm indignant, because
those people are treating my sex with an outrageous
and high-handed effrontery that would
bring the blush of impotent rage to any masculine
cheek!"</p>

<p>"What people?" said the other warily. "You
needn't answer till you get your wits back."</p>

<p>"They're back, Curt; that twelve-foot fence of
heavy elephant-proof wire which we noticed in
the forest day before yesterday isn't the fencing
to a game park. It encloses a thousand acres
belonging to the New Race University. Did you
know that?"</p>

<p>"What's The New Race University?" asked
Langdon, astonished.</p>

<p>"You won't believe it&mdash;but, Curtis, it's a reser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>vation
for the&mdash;the p-p-propagation of a new
and s-s-symmetrically p-p-proportioned race of
g-g-god-like human beings! It's a deliberate attempt
at cold-blooded scientific selection&mdash;an insult
to every bald-headed, near-sighted, thin-shanked
young man in the United States!"</p>

<p>"William," said the other, coaxingly, "you had
better lie down and let me make some wafer soup
for you."</p>

<p>"You listen to me. I'm getting calmer now.
I want to tell you about these New Race women
and their University and Amourette and Reginald
Willett and the whole devilish business."</p>

<p>"Is there&mdash;is there really such a thing, William?
You would not tell me a bind like that just
to make a goat of me, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't. There <i>is</i> such a thing."</p>

<p>"Did you see it?"</p>

<p>"No, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Amourette told me&mdash;shamelessly, defiantly,
adorably! It was organised in secret out of the
most advanced and determined as well as the most
healthy, vigorous, and physically beautiful of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
the suffragettes in North America. One of their
number happened to own a thousand acres here
before the State took the rest for its park. And
here they have come, dozens and dozens of them&mdash;to
attend the first summer session of the New
Race University."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is there actually a University in these
woods?"</p>

<p>"There is."</p>

<p>"Buildings?" demanded Langdon, amazed.</p>

<p>"No, burrows. Isn't that the limit? Curt, believe
me, they live in caves. It's their idea of being
vigorous and simple and primitive. Their
cult is the cave woman. They have classes; they
study and recite and exercise and cook and play
auction bridge. Their object is to hasten not
only political enfranchisement, but the era of a
physical and intellectual equality which will permit
them to mate as they choose and people this
republic with perfect progeny. Every girl there
is pledged to mate only with the very pick of
physical masculine perfection. Their pledge is to
build up a new, god-like race on earth, which ultimately
will dominate, crush out, survive, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
replace all humanity which has become degenerate.
Nothing mentally or physically or politically imperfect
is permitted inside that wire fence. My
eye-glasses bar me out; your shanks exclude you&mdash;also
your politics, because you're a democrat."</p>

<p>"That's monstrous!" exclaimed Langdon, indignantly.</p>

<p>"More monstrous still, these disciples of the
New Race movement are militant! Their audacity
is unbelievable! Certain ones among them, adepts
in woodcraft, have now begun to range this forest
with nets. What do you think of that! And
when they encounter a young fellow who agrees
with the remorseless standard of perfection set
up by the University, they stalk him and net him!
They've got four so far. And now it's Amourette's
turn to go out!"</p>

<p>Langdon's teeth chattered.</p>

<p>"W-w-what are they g-going to do with their
captures?"</p>

<p>"Marry them!"</p>

<p>"Willett? And Carrick and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't it awful, Curt?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
"Was she the girl with the net in the photo?
I mean, was that her hand?"</p>

<p>"No; that was a friend of her's who bagged
Willett. Amourette started out yesterday for the
first time after&mdash;well, I suppose you'd call it 'big
game.' She saw me, stalked me, got near enough
to see my glasses, and let me go. And to-day,
thinking that she might have been mistaken and
that perhaps I only wore sun-glasses, she came
back. But I was ass enough to take off my cap
to her, and she saw my hair&mdash;saw where it wasn't&mdash;and
that settled it."</p>

<p>"What a mortifying thing to happen to you,
William."</p>

<p>"I should think so. There's nothing unusual
the matter with me. C&aelig;sar was bald. It's idiotic
to bar a man out because he has fewer hairs than
the next man. And the exasperating part of it
is that I believe I could win her if I had half a
chance."</p>

<p>"Of course you could. If she's any good as a
sport, she'd rather have you, hairless myopiac
that you are, than a tailor's dummy."</p>

<p>Sayre said: "Isn't it a terrible thing, Curtis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
to think of that sweet, lovely young girl pledged
to a scientific life like that? P-pledged to p-p-propagate
p-p-perfection?"</p>

<p>"What a mean-spirited creature that fellow
Willett must be," observed Langdon in disgust;
"and the other three&mdash;Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"To tamely submit to being kidnapped and
woo'd and wed that way&mdash;endure the degradation
of a captivity among all those young girls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sayre said: "Would <i>you</i> call for help if kidnapped?"</p>

<p>Langdon gazed into space: "I wonder," he
murmured.</p>

<p>Sayre looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you'd make the welkin ring
with your yelps. It's probably the same with
those four men."</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose those suffragettes of the New
Race University really require any fence there to
keep those men in."</p>

<p>"No; only to keep the rest of us out."</p>

<p>"The chances are that Willett and that poet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
Carrick and De Lancy Smith and Alphonso W.
Green couldn't be chased out of that University."</p>

<p>"Those <i>are</i> the chances. How I hate those
four men. It's curious, William, that no man can
ever tolerate the idea of any other man ever getting
solid with any looker. I always did dislike
to see another man with a pretty girl. . . .
William?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Think of the concentrated beauty in that University!
Think of that rich round-up of creamy
dreams! Consider that mellifluous marmalade!
And&mdash;we can't have any&mdash;because <i>you</i> are
slightly bald and near-sighted and <i>I</i> am thin and
scholarly!" He ran at the camp-kettle and
kicked it.</p>

<p>After a painful silence Sayre said timidly:
"Don't laugh, but <i>is</i> there any known substance
which will bring in hair?"</p>

<p>"You mean bring it out?"</p>

<p>"Well, dammit, grow it! Is there?"</p>

<p>"There are too many bald monarchs and millionaires
to prove the contrary. Nor is there anything
that can make my thin shanks fatter."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
"&mdash;I'd be willing to go about without glasses,"
said Sayre humbly. "I told her so."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you deceive her with a wig? It
wouldn't matter afterward. After you're once
married let her shriek."</p>

<p>"Amourette <i>saw</i> my head." And he hung it in
bitter dejection.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Langdon cheerily. "Let's
peek through their fence and see what happens.
Much has been done with a merry eye in this
world of haughty ladies."</p>

<p>As they turned away into the woods Sayre
clenched his fists.</p>

<p>"I'd like to knock the collective blocks off those
four young men inside that fence. And&mdash;to
think&mdash;to <i>think</i> of Amourette going out again
to-morrow, man hunting, with her net! I can't
endure it, Curt&mdash;I simply can't."</p>

<p>Langdon looked at his friend in deep commiseration.</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you, William&mdash;but I don't
see&mdash;I&mdash;don't&mdash;exactly&mdash;see&mdash;&mdash;" He hesitated.
"Of course I <i>could</i> go to Utica and pay a wig-maker
and costumer to make me up into the kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
of Charlie-Gussie they're looking for at that University. . . .
And when your best girl goes out
hunting, she'll see me and net me, and you can
be in hiding near by, and rush out and net her."</p>

<p>In their excitement they seized each other and
danced.</p>

<p>"Why not?" exclaimed Langdon. "Shall I try?
Trust me to come back a specimen of sickening
symmetry&mdash;the kind of man women write about
and draw pictures of&mdash;pink and white and silky-whiskered!
Shall I? And I'll bring you a net to
catch her in! Is it a go, William?"</p>

<p>Sayre broke down and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, friend," he sobbed. "And
if ever I get that girl inside a net she'll learn something
about natural selection that they p-p-probably
forgot to teach in their accursed New Race
University!"</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> week later Curtis Langdon sat on the
banks of a trout stream fishing, apparently
deeply absorbed in his business;
but he was listening so hard that his ears hurt
him.</p>

<p>A few yards away, ambushed behind a rock on
which was painted "Votes for Women," lurked
William Sayre. A net lay on the ground beside
him, fashioned with ring and detachable handle
like a gigantic butterfly net.</p>

<p>He, too, tremendously excited, was listening and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
watching the human bait&mdash;Langdon being cast for
the bait.</p>

<p>Perfect and nauseating beauty now marked that
young gentleman. Features and figure were symmetrical;
his eyebrows had been pencilled into
exact arcs, his mouth was a Cupid's bow, his
cheeks were softly rosy, and a silky and sickly
moustache shadowed his rosy lips. Under his
fashionable outing shirt he wore a rubber chest
improver; his cunningly padded shoulders recalled
the exquisite sartorial creations of Mart, Haffner,
and Sharx; his patent puttees gave him a calf to
which his personal shanks had never aspired;
thick, golden-brown hair, false as a woman's
vows, was tossed carelessly from a brow, snowy
with pearl powder. And he wore a lilac-edged
handkerchief in his left cuff.</p>

<p>Both young men truly felt that if any undergraduate
of the New Race University was out
stalking she'd have at least one try at such a bait.
Nothing feminine and earnest could resist that
glutinous agglomeration of charms.</p>

<p>But they had now been there since before dawn;
nothing had broken the sun-lit quiet of forest and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
water, not even a trout; and they listened in vain
for the snapping of the classical twig.</p>

<p>Lunch time came; they ate a pad apiece.
Neither dared to smoke, Sayre because it might
reveal his hiding place, Langdon because smoking
might be considered an imperfection in the University.</p>

<p>Sunlight fell warm on the banks of the stream,
the leaves rustled, big white clouds floated in the
blue above. Nothing came near Langdon except
a few mosquitoes, who couldn't bite through the
make-up; and a small and inquisitive bird that
inspected him with disdain and said, "cheep&mdash;che-ep!"
so many times that Langdon took it as
a personal comment and almost blushed.</p>

<p>He thought to himself: "If it wasn't that William
is actually becoming ill over his unhappy
love affair I'm damned if I'd let even a dicky-bird
see me in this rig. Ugh! What a head of hair!
The average girl's ideal is what every healthy
man wants to kick. I wouldn't blame any decent
fellow for booting me into the brook on sight."</p>

<p>He bit into his pad and sat chewing reflectively
and dabbling his line in the water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
"Poor old William," he mused. "This business
is likely to end us both. If we stay here we lose
our jobs; if we go back William is likely to increase
the nut crop. I never supposed men took
love as seriously as that. I've heard that it sometimes
occurred&mdash;what is it Shakespeare says:
'How Love doth make nuts of us all!'"</p>

<p>He chewed his pad and swung his feet, philosophically.</p>

<p>"Why the devil doesn't some girl come and try
to steal a kiss?" he muttered. "It might perhaps
be well to call their attention to my helpless presence
and unguarded condition."</p>

<p>So he sang for a while, swinging his legs:
"Somebody's watching and waiting for me!"
munching his luncheon between verses; and, as nobody
came, he bawled louder and louder the refrain:
"Somebody's darling, darling, dah-ling!"
until a hoarse voice from behind the rock silenced
him:</p>

<p>"Shut up that hurdy-gurdy voice of yours! A
defect like that will count ten points against you!
Can it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Langdon, offended; "but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
everybody doesn't feel the way you do about music."</p>

<p>Silence resumed her classical occupation in the
forest; the stream continued to sparkle and make
its own kind of music; the trout, having become
accustomed to the queer thing on the bank and
the baited hook among the pebbles, gathered in
the ripples stemming the current with winnowing
fins.</p>

<p>A very young rabbit sat up in a fern patch and
examined Langdon with dark, moist eyes. He
sat there for several minutes, and might have remained
for several more if a sound, unheard by
Langdon and by Sayre, had not set the bunch of
whiskers on his restless nose twitching, and sent
him scurrying off over the moss.</p>

<p>The sound was no sound to human ears; Langdon
heard it not; Sayre, drowsy in the scented
heat, dozed behind his rock.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the moss; then another;
two slim shapes moved stealthily among the trees
across the brook.</p>

<p>For ten minutes the foremost figure stood looking
at Langdon. Occasionally she used an opera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
glass, which, from time to time, she passed back
over her shoulder to her companion.</p>

<p>"Ethra," she whispered at last, "he seems to
be practically perfect."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering about those puttees, dear&mdash;shanks
in puttees are deceptive."</p>

<p>"Those are exquisite calves," said Amourette
sadly. "I'm sure they'll measure up to regulation.
And his chest seems up to proof."</p>

<p>"What beautiful eyebrows," murmured Ethra.</p>

<p>But Amourette found no pleasure in them, nor
in the golden-brown hair, nor the bloom of youth
and perfect health pervading their unconscious
quarry. Perhaps she was thinking of a certain
near-sighted, thin-haired young man&mdash;and how she
had slammed the gate of the wire fence in his
face&mdash;<i>after</i> their first kiss.</p>

<p>She drew a deep, painful breath and lifted her
head resolutely.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd better begin to stalk him, Ethra,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes; he's a very good specimen. Be careful,
dear. Strike a circle and come up behind him.
When you're ready, mew like a cat-bird and I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
let him catch a glimpse of me. And as soon as
he begins to&mdash;to rubber," she said, with a haughty
glance at the unconscious angler, "steal up and
net him, and I'll come across and help tie him up."</p>

<p>Amourette sighed, standing there irresolute.
Then she straightened her drooping shoulders,
seized her net very firmly, and, with infinite caution,
began to stalk her quarry.</p>

<p>Once the stalking had fairly begun, the girl
became absorbed in the game. All memory of
Sayre, if there indeed had been any to make her
falter in her purpose, now departed. She was
a huntress pure and simple, silent, furtive, adroit,
intent upon her quarry. There came a kind of
fierceness into her concentration; the joy of the
chase thrilled her as she crept noiselessly through
the woods, describing a circle, crossing the stream
far above the sleepy fisherman, gliding, stealing
nearer, nearer, until at length she stood in the
thicket behind him.</p>

<p>For a moment she waited silently, freeing her
net and gathering it in her right hand ready for
a deadly cast. Then, pursing up her red lips,
she mewed like a cat-bird, three times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
Instantly, across the stream, she saw Ethra
step out of the willows into plain view; saw Langdon
wake up, stare, get up, and regard the beautiful
vision across the stream with concentrated
and delighted attention.</p>

<p>Then Amourette stole swiftly forward over the
moss, swinging the heavy silken net in her right
hand, closer, closer. Suddenly the net whistled
in the air, glistened, lengthened, and fell, enmeshing
Langdon; and, at the same instant something
behind her whistled and fell slap; and she found
herself struggling in the folds of an enormous
butterfly net.</p>

<p>"Ethra! Help!" she cried, terrified, trying to
keep her balance in the web which enveloped her,
striving to tear a way free through the meshes;
but she was only wrapped up the tighter; two
brutal masculine arms lifted her, held her cradled
and entangled, freed the handle from the net, and
bore her swiftly away.</p>

<p>"Darling," whispered William Sayre, "d-don't
kick."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>!" she gasped, struggling frantically.</p>

<p>"The real thing, dearest of women! The old-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>fashioned,
original cave man. Will you come
quietly? There's a license bureau in the next
village. Or shall I be obliged to keep right on
carrying you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, <i>oh</i>!" she sobbed; "what disgrace! what
humiliation; what shame! Oh, Ethra! Ethra!
What in the world am I to do?"</p>

<p>"That's where the mistake arose," said William
gently; "<i>you</i> don't have to do anything&mdash;except
put both arms around my neck and&mdash;be careful
not to knock off my glasses."</p>

<p>"<i>Glasses</i>! Ethra! Ethra! Where are you?
Don't you see what is becoming of me? You&mdash;you
had b-better hurry, too," she added with a
sob, "because the man who is carrying me off is
the man I told you about. <i>Ethra</i>! Where are
you?"</p>

<p>A convenient echo replied in similar terms.
Meanwhile Sayre was walking faster and faster
through the woods.</p>

<p>For a while she lay motionless and silent, cradled
in his arms. And after a long, long time she tried
feebly to adjust the disordered ondulations on her
hair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
Then a very small, still voice said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Sayre?"</p>

<p>"Darling!"</p>

<p>She seemed to recognise this as her name.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sayre, w-what are you going to do with
me?"</p>

<p>"Marry you."</p>

<p>"B-b-by f-f-force?"</p>

<p>"That is up to you, darling."</p>

<p>"Against my will?"</p>

<p>"That also is up to you."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and my inclination?"</p>

<p>"No, not against that, Amourette."</p>

<p>"Do you dare believe I love you?"</p>

<p>"I should worry."</p>

<p>"Do you know you are hurting me, physically,
spiritually, mentally?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I am."</p>

<p>"Do you realise that you are a brute?"</p>

<p>"I sure do. We're all of us a little in that line,
Amourette."</p>

<p>After a long silence she turned her face so that
it rested against his shoulder&mdash;nestled closer, and
lay very still.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> over the United States conditions
were becoming terrible, hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of militant
women, wives, widows, matrons, maidens, and
stenographers had gone on strike. Non-intercourse
with man was to be the punishment for any
longer withholding the franchise; husbands,
fathers, uncles, fianc&eacute;s, bachelors, and authors
held frantic mass meetings to determine what
course to pursue in the imminence of rapidly impending
industrial, political, and social disaster.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
But, although men's sufferings threatened to be
frightful; although for months now nobody of
the gentler sex had condescended to pay them the
slightest attention; although their wives replied
to them only with monosyllables and scornful
smiles, and their sweethearts were never at home
to them, let it be remembered to their eternal
credit that not one thought of surrender ever entered
their limited minds.</p>

<p>And so it was with young Langdon, who was
left in a condition neither dignified nor picturesque&mdash;a
martyr to friendship and a victim to his
own rather frivolous idea of practical humour.</p>

<p>Hopelessly entangled in the net which enveloped
him from head to foot, he flopped about
among the dead leaves on the bank of the stream,
struggling and kicking like a fly in a cobweb.
This he considered humorous.</p>

<p>The lithe figure across the brook continued to
view his gyrations with mingled emotions.</p>

<p>She was a boyish young thing with a full-lipped,
sensitive mouth, eyes like bluish-black velvet, and
clipped hair of a dull gold colour that curled
thickly all over a small and beautifully shaped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
head in little burnished <i>boucles d'or</i>&mdash;which description
ought to hold the reader for a while.</p>

<p>She wore gray wool kilts, riding breeches laced
in about the knee, suede puttees and tan shoes;
and she carried a Russian game pouch beautifully
embroidered across her right shoulder.</p>

<p>For a minute or two she watched the entangled
young man, eyes still wide with the excitement
of the chase, full delicate lips softly parted; and
her intent and earnest face reflected modest triumph
charmingly modified by an involuntary sympathy&mdash;the
natural tribute of a generous sportswoman
to the quarry successfully stalked and
bagged.</p>

<p>Cautiously, now, but without hesitation she advanced
to the edge of the stream, picked her way
cleverly across it on the stones, and, leaping lightly
to the bank, stood looking down at Langdon,
who had ceased his contortions and now lay flat
on his back, gazing skyward, a grin on his otherwise
attractive countenance.</p>

<p>He smiled up at her through the meshes of the
net when he encountered her curious eyes, expecting
immediate release.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
There was no answering smile from her as she
coolly examined his symmetrical features and
perfect physical proportions through the folds
of the net.</p>

<p>No, there could be no longer any doubt in her
mind that this young man was what the New
Race University required for breeding purposes.</p>

<p>No such specimen as this could hope to escape
instant marriage. Here were features so mathematically
flawless that they became practically
featureless; here was bodily balance so ideal that
the ultimate standards of Greek perfection seemed
lop-sided in comparison. No, there could be no
doubt about it; this young man was certainly required
for the purpose of scientific propagation;
willy-nilly he was destined to be one of the ancestors
of that future and god-like race which must,
one day, people the earth to replace the bigoted
and degenerate population which at present encumbered
it.</p>

<p>She regarded him without the slightest personal
interest now. His symmetry wearied her profoundly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
"When are you going to let me out?" he asked
cheerfully.</p>

<p>She looked at him almost insolently under
slightly lifted brows.</p>

<p>"Presently," she said; and began to fumble in
her satchel. In a few moments she produced two
bottles, a roll of antiseptic cotton, and a hypodermic
needle.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me voluntarily?" she inquired,
stepping nearer and looking down at him,
"or must I use force?"</p>

<p>He might have been humorously willing to go;
he really desired to see this amusing adventure to
the finish. But man resents coercion.</p>

<p>"Force?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Exactly," she replied, displaying her pocket
pharmacy.</p>

<p>"What are those things you have in your
hand?" he asked, trying to see.</p>

<p>"Chloroform and a hypodermic needle. If you
do not wish to come with me voluntarily you may
take your choice."</p>

<p>He laughed long and loud and derisively.</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous," he said. "Be kind enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
to undo this net. I might have been willing to
go with you and look 'em over&mdash;your friends,
you know; but I don't care for your idea of humour."</p>

<p>"Your reply is typically man-like and tyrannical.
For centuries man has enjoyed and abused
the option of doing what he pleased. Now men
are going to do what <i>we</i> please, whether or not
it suits them."</p>

<p>"So I've understood," he said, laughing; "but
this revolt has been on for a year and I haven't
noticed any men doing what they did not wish
to do."</p>

<p>"We have four who are doing it. They are in
training for their honeymoons. You are to be the
fifth to begin training," she said coolly.</p>

<p>He laughed again derisively, and lay watching
her. She walked up close beside him and
seated herself on the rock marked "Votes for
Women."</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, tauntingly, "that you
were rather astonished to wake up from your fishing
nap, and find yourself&mdash;&mdash;" she considered
the effect of her words, gazing at him insolently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
from under slightly lowered lashes&mdash;"find yourself
all balled up in a fish net."</p>

<p>He only grinned at her.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" she demanded,
unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Lying here flat on my back, I am smiling at
Woman! at every individual woman on earth! at
this ridiculous feminine uprising, this suffragette
revolution&mdash;at your National Female Federation
Committee; the thousands of local unions; this
strike of your entire sex; this general boycott of
my sex! What has it accomplished?" He tried
to wave his hand.</p>

<p>"You parade and make speeches in the streets,
throw bricks, slap the faces of a few State Congressmen,
and finally proclaim a general strike
and boycott.</p>

<p>"And what's the result? All social functions
and ceremonies are suspended; caterers, florists,
confectioners, cabmen, ruined; theatres, restaurants,
department stores, novelists, milliners, in
financial throes; a falling off of over eighty per
cent. in marriages and births&mdash;and you are no
nearer a vote than you were before the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
strike paralysed the business of this Republic."</p>

<p>The young lady had been growing pinker and
pinker.</p>

<p>"Oh! . . . And is that why you are laughing?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's the funniest strike that ever happened
to a serious-minded sex. Because you know
your sex, as a sex, is a trifle destitute of a sense
of humour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That expression," she cut in with bitter satisfaction,
"definitely determines <i>your</i> intellectual
and social limits, Mr. Langdon. You are what
you appear to be&mdash;one of those dreary bothers
whose stock phrase is 'a sense of humour'&mdash;the
kind of young man who has acquired a florid imitation
of cultivation, a sort of near-polish; the
type of person who uses the word 'brainy' for
'capable,' and 'mentality' for 'intelligence'; the
dreadful kind of person who speaks of a subject
as 'meaty' instead of properly employing the
words 'substance' or 'material'; the sort of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Langdon, red and wrathful, sat up on the
ground, peering at her through the enveloping
net.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
"Never in my life," he said, "have I been spoken
to in such terms of feminine contempt. Stop it!
Can't you appreciate a joke?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon, the day is past when women
will either countenance or take part in any disrespectful
witticisms, slurs, or jests at the expense
of their own sex. Once&mdash;and that not very
long ago&mdash;they did it. Comic papers made my
sex the subject of cartoons and witticisms; the
stage dared to spread the contemptible misinformation;
women either smiled or remained indifferent.
The impression became general and fixed
that women were gallinaceous, that a hen-like philosophy
characterised the sex; that they were, at
best, second-rate humans, tagging rather gratefully
at the heels of the Lords of Creation, unconcerned
with the greater and vital questions of the
world.</p>

<p>"Now your sex has discovered its mistake. After
countless centuries of intellectual and physical
bondage Woman has calmly risen to assert herself&mdash;not
as the peer of man, <i>but as his superior</i>!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Langdon, angrily.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Since prehistoric times man has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
attempted to govern and shape the destinies of
all things living on this earth. He has made of
his reign a miserable fizzle. It is our turn now
to try our hands.</p>

<p>"And so, at last, woman steps forward, tipping
the symbols of despotic power&mdash;sceptre and crown&mdash;from
the nerveless hand and dishonoured brow
of her recent lord and master! And down he goes
under her feet&mdash;where he belongs."</p>

<p>Langdon, unable to endure such language, attempted
to sit up, but the net interfered and
he lay clawing at the meshes while the girl calmly
continued:</p>

<p>"The human race, as it is at present, is a disgrace
to the world it inhabits. We women have
now decided to repeople the earth scientifically
with a race as wholesome in body as our instruction
shall render it in mind. Those among us
women who are adjudged physically and mentally
perfect for this great and sacred work have
pledged ourselves to the sacrifice&mdash;<i>pro bono publico</i>.</p>

<p>"We shall pick out, from your degenerate sex,
such physically perfect individuals as chance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
remain; we shall regard our marriages with them
as purely scientific and cold-blooded affairs; we
have begun, for the purposes of re-populating the
world by capturing four symmetrical young men.
You are the fifth. The Regents of the New Race
University will select for you several girls who,
theoretically, are best qualified to become the
mothers of your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted Langdon, tearing violently at
the net. "I don't want you to talk that way
to me!"</p>

<p>"What way?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well," he retorted, blushing
vividly. "I won't stand it!"</p>

<p>"What a slave to prudery and smug convention
you are," she observed with amused contempt.
"Nobody in the University is going to shock your
modesty."</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>are</i> they going to do?"</p>

<p>"Turn you loose in the preserve after the Regents
have inspected you."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose two or three girls will be selected."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
"To do w-what?"</p>

<p>"To pay you marked attention."</p>

<p>"M-m-marked <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Attention. Two or three girls will begin to
court you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual way&mdash;by sending you flowers
and books and bon-bons, and asking permission to
call on you in your cave," she said carelessly.</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed pause, then:</p>

<p>"Will <i>you</i> be one of those&mdash;those aspirants to
my hand?" he inquired.</p>

<p>She said indifferently: "I hope not. I'm sure
I don't desire to be the mother of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! I tell you to stop conversing on such
topics!" he yelled, struggling and squirming and
finally rolling over, all fours in the air.</p>

<p>"I want to get up!" he shouted. "My position
is undignified! Anybody'd think I was a prize
animal. I don't like this poultry talk! I'm a
<i>man</i>! I'm no bench-winner. And if ever I marry
and p-p-produce p-p-progeny, it will be somebody
<i>I</i> select, not somebody who selects <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>The girl looked at him sternly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
"No," she said. "For centuries man has mated
from sentiment and filled the earth with mental
and physical degeneracy. Now woman steps in.
It is her turn. And she flings aside precedent,
prejudice, and sentiment&mdash;for the good of the human
race! and joining hands with Science marches
forward inexorably toward the millennium!"</p>

<p>The girl was so earnest, so na&iuml;ve, so emotionally
stirred by the picture evoked that she enacted
in pretty gestures the allegory of womanhood
trampling upon sentimental emotion and
turning toward Science with arms outstretched.</p>

<p>Langdon, who had managed to sit up, regarded
her with terrified interest.</p>

<p>"Would you be amiable enough to remove this
net?" he asked, shivering.</p>

<p>"I shall take you before the Board of Regents
of the New Race University. They will assign
you a cave."</p>

<p>"This joke has gone far enough," he said.
"Please take off this net."</p>

<p>"No. I am going to show the Regents what
I caught."</p>

<p>"<i>Me?</i>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
"Certainly."</p>

<p>"But, my poor child," he said, "I am not what
I seem. The joke is entirely on woman&mdash;poor,
derided, deluded, down-trodden, humourless woman!
Why, all this symmetry of mine&mdash;all these
endearing young charms, are&mdash;are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, looked at her, reflected, wavered.
She was <i>so</i> pretty&mdash;somehow he didn't want to
tell her. He felt furtively of his rubber chest improver,
his flexible pneumatic calves, his golden
brown wig, his pencilled brows, silky moustache,
and carefully fashioned rosebud mouth. . . . A
sudden and curious distaste for confessing to her
that all the beauties were unreal came over
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, paying him no further attention for
the moment, she was trying hard to uncork the
bottle of chloroform.</p>

<p>When she succeeded, she soaked the roll of
antiseptic cotton, folded it in a handkerchief, and
re-corked the bottle. Then, eyeing him coldly,
holding the saturated handkerchief with one hand,
her pretty nose with the other, she said with nasal
difficulty:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
"Dow, Bister Lagdod, bake up your bind dot
to struggle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you actually going to do it?" he asked,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"I ab!" she replied firmly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! <i>You</i> are not accustomed to give
chloroform!"</p>

<p>"Do; but I've read up od the subject&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, horrified. "Look out
what you're doing, child! Don't you dare try
that on me!"</p>

<p>"I've got to," she insisted. "Please dod bake
be dervous or we bay have ad accidend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take that stuff away!" he yelled. "You'll
give me too much and then I won't wake up at
all!"</p>

<p>"I'll be as careful as I cad," she promised him.
"Dow be still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But this is monstrous!" he retorted, flopping
about in the leaves like a stranded fish and frantically
endeavouring to dodge the wet and reeking
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Let go of my nose! Help! He&mdash;he&mdash;hah&mdash;h&mdash;um!
bz-z-z-z&mdash;&mdash;" and he suddenly relaxed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
and fell back a limp, loose-limbed mass among the
leaves.</p>

<p>Pale and resolute the girl knelt beside him,
freed him from the net, and, bending nearer, gazed
earnestly into his unconscious features. Still gazing,
she drew a postman's whistle from her satchel,
set it to her lips, and was about to summon the
student on duty at the distant gate to help bring
in the quarry, when something about the features
of the recumbent young man arrested her attention.</p>

<p>The postman's whistle fell from her pretty lips;
her startled eyes widened as she bent closer to
examine the perfections which had captivated her
from a scientific standpoint.</p>

<p>At that instant consciousness began to return;
he gave a sudden spasmodic and comprehensive
flop; there was a report like a pistol. His chest
improver had exploded.</p>

<p>Terrified, trembling, she dropped on her knees
beside him; never before had she heard of a young
man being blown to pieces by chloroform. Then,
almost hysterical, she ran to the stream, filled her
leather satchel with water, and, running back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
again, emptied it upon his upturned countenance.</p>

<p>Horror on horror! His golden brown hair&mdash;his
very scalp seemed to be parting from his forehead&mdash;eyebrows,
silky moustache, lips&mdash;his entire
face seemed to be coming off; and, as she shrieked
and tottered to her feet, he began to sputter and
kick so violently that both pneumatic calves blew
up like the reports of a double-barreled shotgun.</p>

<p>And Ethra reeled back against a tree and cowered
there, covering her shocked eyes with shaking
fingers.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a surprising and trying moment for a
girl who throws water upon a young man's
face to see that face begin to dissolve and
come off, feature by feature, in polychromatic
splendour.</p>

<p>She did not faint; her intellect reeled for a
moment; then she dropped her hands from her
eyes and saw him sitting up on the ground, blinking
at her gravely from a streaked and gaudy
countenance. His wig was tilted over one eye;
rouge and pearl powder made his cheeks and chin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
very gay; and his handsome, silky moustache hung
by one corner from his upper lip. It was too
much. She sat down limply on a mossy log and
wept.</p>

<p>His senses returned gradually; after a while he
got up and walked down to the edge of the brook
with all the dignity that unsteady legs permitted.</p>

<p>Fascinated, she watched him at his ablutions
where he squatted by the water's edge, scrubbing
away as industriously as a washer-racoon. It did
not occur to her to flee; curiosity dominated&mdash;an
overpowering desire to see what he really resembled
in <i>puris naturalibus</i>.</p>

<p>After a while he stood up, hurled the damp
wig into the woods, wiped his hands on his knickerbockers
and his face on his sleeve, and, bending
over, examined his collapsed calves.</p>

<p>And all the while, as the fumes of the chloroform
disappeared and he began to realise what
had been done to him, he was becoming madder
and madder.</p>

<p>She recognised the wrath in his face as he
swung on his heel and came toward her.</p>

<p>"It is your own fault!" she said, resolutely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
"for playing a silly trick like&mdash;&mdash;" But she observed
his advance very dubiously, straightening
up to her full slender height to confront him,
but not rising to her feet. Her knees were still
very shaky.</p>

<p>He halted close in front of her. Something
in the interrogative yet fearless beauty of her
upward gaze checked the torrent of indignant eloquence
under which he was labouring, and, presently,
left him even mentally mute, his lips parted
stupidly.</p>

<p>She said: "According to the old order of things
a well-bred man would ask my pardon. But a
decently-bred man, in the first place, wouldn't
have done such a thing to me. So your apology
would only be a paradox&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, stung into protest. "Am
I to understand that after netting me and chloroforming
me and nearly drowning me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My mistake was perfectly natural. Do you
suppose that I would even dream of trailing <i>you</i>
as you really are?"</p>

<p>He gazed at her bewildered; passed his unsteady
hand over his countenance, then sat down abruptly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
beside her on the mossy log and buried his head
in his hands.</p>

<p>She looked at him haughtily, sitting up very
straight; he continued beside her in silence, face
in his hands as though overwhelmed. Nothing
was said for several minutes&mdash;until the clear disdain
of her gaze changed, imperceptibly; and the
rigidity of her spinal column relaxed.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry this has happened," she said.
There was, however, no sympathy in her tone. He
made no movement to speak.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she repeated after a moment.
"It is hard to suffer humiliation."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is."</p>

<p>"But you deserved it."</p>

<p>"How? I didn't fashion my face and figure."</p>

<p>She mistook him: "<i>Somebody</i> did."</p>

<p>"Yes; my parents."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that silly make-up," he said,
raising his head.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean my own face and figure. What you
did to me&mdash;your netting me, doping me, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
that wasn't a patch on what you said afterward."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What did I say?"</p>

<p>"You asked me if I supposed that you would
dream of netting a man with a face and f-figure
like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;you&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did! And can any man suffer any humiliation
to compare with words like those? I
merely ask you."</p>

<p>With eyes dilated, breath coming quickly, she
stared at him, scarcely yet comprehending the
blow which her words had dealt to one of the lords
of creation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon," she said, "do you suppose that
I am the sort of girl to deliberately criticise either
your features or your figure?"</p>

<p>"But you did."</p>

<p>"I merely meant that you should infer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I inferred it all right," he said bitterly.</p>

<p>Perplexed, not knowing how to encounter such
an unexpected reproach, vaguely distressed by it,
she instinctively attempted to clear herself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
"Please listen. I hadn't any idea of mortifying
you by explaining that you are not qualified by
nature to interest the modern woman in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned a bright red.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose such a condemnation&mdash;such
a total ostracism&mdash;is agreeable to a man? . . . Is
there anything worse you can say about a man
than to inform him that no woman could possibly
take the slightest interest in him?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that. I said the modern woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're all modern."</p>

<p>"It is reported that there are still a few women
sufficiently old-fashioned to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They don't interest me." He looked up at
her. "What <i>you've</i> said has&mdash;simply&mdash;and completely&mdash;spoiled&mdash;my
life," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"What <i>I</i> said?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What have&mdash;what could&mdash;what I&mdash;how&mdash;where&mdash;who
is&mdash;&mdash;" and she checked herself, eyes
on his.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated with a curious sort of satisfaction,
"you have spoiled my entire life for me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
"What an utterly&mdash;what a wildly absurd and
impossible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you <i>know</i> it!" he insisted, with gloomy
triumph.</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"That you've spoiled&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Will you explain to me how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?"</p>

<p>"Necessary? Of course it is! You have made
a most grave and serious and&mdash;and heartless
charge against a woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, a heartless one&mdash;against you!"</p>

<p>"I? <i>Heartless?</i>"</p>

<p>"Cold, deliberate, cruel, unfeeling, merciless, remorseless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you practically tell me that no woman
could endure the sight of a face and figure like
mine?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not. What a&mdash;a cruel accusation!"</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> you mean, then?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that you are not exactly&mdash;qualified to&mdash;to
become an ancestor of the physically perfect
race which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
"What <i>is</i> wrong with me, then?"</p>

<p>She looked at him helplessly. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean where am I below proof? Where am
I lacking? What points count me out?"</p>

<p>Her sensitive underlip began to tremble.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't want to criticise you&mdash;&mdash;" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Please do. I beg of you. There are beauty
doctors in town," he added earnestly. "They can
fix up a fellow&mdash;and I can go to a gymnasium,
and take up deep-breathing and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Langdon, do <i>you</i> want to&mdash;to be&mdash;captured&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked into her bright and melting eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I'd like to give you another
chance at me."</p>

<p>"Me? After what I did to you?"</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>"Why, what a perfectly astonishing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not very. Look me over and tell me what
points count against me. I know I'm not good-looking,
but I'd like to go into training for the
bench&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
"Mr. Langdon," she said slowly, "surely <i>you</i>
would not care to develop the featureless symmetry
and the&mdash;the monotonous perfection necessary
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would. I wish to become superficially
monotonous. I'm too varied; I realise
that. I want to resemble that make-up I
wore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That! Goodness! What a horrid idea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horrid? Didn't you like it well enough to
net me?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;there was nothing expressive of my personal
taste in my capturing you&mdash;I mean the kind
of a man you appeared to be. It was my duty&mdash;a
purely scientific matter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what it was. You went after
me. You wouldn't go after me as I now appear.
I want you to tell me what is lacking in me which
would prevent you going after me again&mdash;from
a purely scientific standpoint."</p>

<p>She sat breathing irregularly, rather rapidly,
pretty head bent, apparently considering her
hands, which lay idly in her lap. Then she lifted
her blue eyes and inspected him. And it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
curious, too, that, now when she came to examine
him, she did not seem to discover any faults.</p>

<p>"My nose doesn't suit you, does it?" he asked
candidly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said innocently, "it suits me."</p>

<p>"That's funny," he reflected. "How about my
ears?"</p>

<p>"They seem to be all right," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"They seem to me to be perfectly good ears."</p>

<p>"That's odd. What <i>is</i> there queer about my
face?"</p>

<p>She looked in vain for imperfections.</p>

<p>"Why, do you know, Mr. Langdon, I don't seem
to notice anything that is not entirely and agreeably
classical."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;my legs are thin."</p>

<p>"Not very."</p>

<p>"Aren't they too thin?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>too</i> thin. . . . Perhaps you might ride a
bicycle for a few days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will!" he exclaimed with a boyish enthusiasm
which lighted up his face so attractively that she
found it fascinating to watch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
"Do you know," she said slowly, "the chances
are that I would have netted you anyway. It
just occurred to me."</p>

<p>"Without my make-up?" he asked, in delighted
surprise.</p>

<p>"I think so. Why not?" she replied, looking at
him with growing interest. "I don't see anything
the matter with you."</p>

<p>"My chest improver exploded," he ventured,
being naturally honest.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't think you require it."</p>

<p>"Don't you? That is the nicest thing you ever
said to me."</p>

<p>"It's only the truth," she said, flushing a trifle
in her intense interest. "And, as far as your
legs are concerned, I really do not believe
you need a bicycle or anything else. . . . In
fact&mdash;in fact&mdash;<i>I</i> don't see why you shouldn't go
with me to the University if&mdash;if you&mdash;care
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You darling!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon! Wh-what a perfectly odd thing
to s-say to me!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it," he said with enthusiasm;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
"I really didn't mean it. What I meant was&mdash;you
know&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. She was absorbed in contemplating
one small thumb.</p>

<p>"I'm all ready to go," he ventured.</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>"Shall we?"</p>

<p>She looked up, looked into his youthful eyes.
After a moment she rose, a trifle pale. And he
followed beside her through the sun-lit woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the gate of the New Race University
and Masculine Beauty Preserve the
pretty gate-keeper on duty looked at
Langdon, then at his fair captor, in unfeigned
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, Ethra!" she said, "is <i>that</i> all you've
brought home?"</p>

<p>"Did you think I was going to net a dozen?"
asked Ethra Leslie, warmly. "Please unlock the
gate. Mr. Langdon is tired and hungry, and I
want the Regents to finish with him quickly so
that he can have some luncheon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
The gate-keeper, a distractingly pretty red-haired
girl, regarded Langdon with dubious hazel
eyes.</p>

<p>"He'll never pass the examination," she whispered
to Ethra. "What on earth are you thinking
of?"</p>

<p>"What are <i>you</i> thinking of, Marcella? You
must be perfectly blind not to see that he complies
with every possible requisite! The Regents'
inspection is bound to be only a brief formality.
Be good enough to unbar the gates."</p>

<p>Marcella slowly drew the massive bolts; hostile
criticism was in the gaze with which she swept
Langdon.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the insignificant looking young
men," she murmured to herself as Ethra and her
acquisition walked away along the path, side by
side.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> collective and individual charms of
the Board of Regents so utterly over-powered
Langdon that he scarcely realised
what was happening to him.</p>

<p>First, at their request, he sat cross-legged on
the ground; and they walked round and round
him, inspecting him. Under such conditions no
man could be at his best; there was a silly expression
on his otherwise attractive face, which,
as their attitude toward him seemed to waver
between indifference and disapproval, became unconsciously
appealing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
"Kindly rise, Mr. Langdon," said Miss Challis,
chairman of the board.</p>

<p>Langdon got up, and his ears turned red with
a sudden and burning self-consciousness.</p>

<p>"Please walk past us two or three times, varying
your speed."</p>

<p>He walked in the various styles to which he
had been accustomed, changing speed at intervals
and running the entire gamut between a graceful
boulevard saunter and a lost-dog sprint.</p>

<p>"Now," said the beautiful chairman, "be good
enough to run past us several times."</p>

<p>He complied and they studied his kangaroo-like
action. Miss Vining even bent over and felt
of his ankles doubtfully, and to his vivid confusion
Miss Darrell strolled up, made him sit down
on a log, placed one soft, white finger on his mouth,
and, opening it coolly, examined the interior.
Then they drew together, consulting in whispers,
then Miss Challis came with a stethoscope and
listened to his pneumatic machinery, while Miss
Vining carelessly pinched his biceps and tried his
reflexes. After which Miss Darrell pushed a thermometer
into his mouth, measured his pulses and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
blood pressure, tested his sight and hearing and
his sense of smell. The latter was intensely keen,
as he was very hungry.</p>

<p>Then Miss Challis came and stood behind him
and examined, phrenologically, the bumps on his
head, while Miss Vining, seated at his feet, read
his palm, and Miss Darrell produced a dream book
and a pack of cards, and carefully cast his horoscope.
But, except that it transpired that he was
going to take a journey, that somebody was going
to leave him money, and that a dark lady was
coming over the sea to trouble him, nothing particularly
exciting was discovered concerning him.</p>

<p>Miss Challis, relinquishing his head, produced
a crystal and gazed into it. She did not say what
she saw there. Miss Vining tried to hypnotise
him and came near hypnotising herself. Which
scared and irritated her; and she let him very
carefully alone after that.</p>

<p>And all the while Ethra sat on a tree stump,
hands tightly clasped in her lap, looking on with
pathetic eagerness and timidly searching the
pretty faces of the Board of Regents for any
hopeful signs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
Presently the Board retired to a neighbouring
cave to confer; and Langdon drew a deep breath
of relief.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, smiling at Ethra, "what do you
think?"</p>

<p>"It will be horrid of them if they don't award
you a blue ribbon," she said.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he faltered, "do they give
ribbons?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, first, second, third, and honourable
mention. It is the scientific and proper method
of classification."</p>

<p>Fury empurpled his visage.</p>

<p>"That's the limit!" he shouted, but she silenced
him with a gesture, nodding her head toward the
surrounding woods; and among the trees he caught
sight of scores and scores of pretty girls furtively
observing the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Don't let them see you display any temper or
you'll lose their good will, Mr. Langdon. Please
recollect that there is no sentiment in this proceeding;
it is a scientific matter to be scientifically
recorded&mdash;purely a matter of eugenics."</p>

<p>Langdon gazed around him at the distant and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
charming faces peeping at him from behind trees
and bushes. Everywhere bright eyes met his mischievously,
gaily. An immense sense of happiness
began to invade him. The enraptured and fatuous
smile on his features now became almost idiotic
as here and there, among the trees, he caught
glimpses of still more young girls strolling about,
arms interlacing one another's waists. The prospect
dazzled him; his wits spun like a humming
top.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are many ladies likely to come and&mdash;and
court me?" he asked timidly of Ethra.</p>

<p>A quick little pang shot through her; but she
said with a forced smile: "Why do you ask?
Are you a coquette, Mr. Langdon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! But, for example, I wouldn't mind
being rushed by that willowy blonde over there.
I'd also like to meet the svelte one with store puffs
and sorrel hair. She <i>is</i> a looker, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"She is certainly very pretty," said Ethra, biting
her lips with unfeigned vexation.</p>

<p>He gazed entranced at the distant throng for
a while.</p>

<p>"And that little grey-eyed romp&mdash;the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
young and slim one," he continued enthusiastically.
"Me for a hammock with her in the goosy-goosy
moonlight. . . . And I hope I'm going to meet
a lot more&mdash;every one of 'em. . . . <i>What</i> on earth
is <i>that</i>?" he exclaimed, changing countenance and
leaning forward. "By Jinks, it's a <i>man</i>!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. There are four men here. You
knew that."</p>

<p>"I forgot," he said, glowering at the unwelcome
sight of his own sex.</p>

<p>Ethra said: "Oh, yes, there are those first
four men we caught&mdash;Mr. Willett, Mr. Carrick,
Mr. Smith, and Mr. Green." She added carelessly:
"I have been paying rather marked attention
to Alphonso W. Green."</p>

<p>"To whom?" he asked, with a disagreeable sensation
drenching out the sparks of joy in his
bosom.</p>

<p>"To Alphonso W. Green. . . . And I've jollied
De Lancy Smith with bon-bons a bit, too. They
are having a lot of attention paid them&mdash;and
they're rather spoiled. But, of course, any girl
can marry any one of them if she really wants
to."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
Langdon gazed miserably at her; she seemed to
be pleasantly immersed in her own reflections and
paid no further heed to him. Then he cast a
scowling glance in the direction of the young man
who was gathering wild flowers and arranging
them in a little basket.</p>

<p>"Ethra," he began&mdash;and stopped short under
the sudden and unexpected unfriendliness of her
glance. "Miss Leslie," he resumed, reddening, "I
wouldn't have come here unless I thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;believed&mdash;that
you would pay <i>me</i> m-m-marked&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Langdon!</i>"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Men do not assume the initiative here. They
make no advances; they wait until a girl pays
them attentions so unmistakable that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>did</i> come here because of you!" he
blurted out angrily.</p>

<p>"That is an exceedingly indelicate avowal!" she
retorted. "If the Regents hear you talk that way
you won't be permitted to receive any girl unchaperoned."</p>

<p>He gazed at her, bewildered; she stood a mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>ment
frowning and looking in the direction of the
cave whither the Board of Regents had retired.</p>

<p>"They're calling me," she exclaimed as a figure
appeared at the cave entrance and beckoned her.</p>

<p>"I won't be long, Mr. Langdon. I am perfectly
confident that you have passed the inspection!"
And she walked swiftly across to the edge
of the thicket where the three Regents stood outside
their cave.</p>

<p>As she came up one of them put her arm around
her.</p>

<p>"My poor child," she said, "that man will never
do."</p>

<p>"W-what!" faltered the girl, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Why, no. How in the world could you make
such a mistake?"</p>

<p>Ethra looked piteously from one to another.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with him?" she asked. "I
can't see anything the matter with him. If his
legs are a trifle&mdash;refined in contour&mdash;a bicycle
will help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Ethra, this is not a hospital, dear. This
is not a sanitarium. We don't want any imperfect
living creature inside this preserve."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
"W-w-what is your decision?" asked the girl;
and her underlip began to quiver, but she controlled
it.</p>

<p>"The first vote," said Miss Challis, "was for
his instant eviction, Miss Vining dissenting. The
second vote was for his expulsion with the privilege
of taking another examination in three months&mdash;Miss
Darrell dissenting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think he's the limit," said Miss Darrell.</p>

<p>"Why, Jessica!" exclaimed Ethra, swallowing
a sob.</p>

<p>"The next vote," continued Betty Challis, "was
whether he might not remain here a day or two
for closer observation. Jessica hasn't voted yet,
but Phyllis Vining and I are willing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jessica!" pleaded Ethra, catching her
hands and pressing them to her own breast, "I&mdash;I
beg you will let him remain&mdash;if only for a few
days! Please, please, dear. I <i>know</i> his calves
will grow if scientifically massaged; and if he is
hygienically fed he will improve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Darrell looked curiously at her; under
her hands the girl's heart was beating wildly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Betty," she said to Miss Challis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
"I vote we keep him under observation for a day
or two. Give him the yellow ribbon." And, bending,
she kissed Ethra lightly on the lips, whispering:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we won't be able to keep him, dear.
But if you'd like to have a little fun with him
and jolly him along, why&mdash;why, I was a flirt
myself in the old days of the old regime."</p>

<p>"That is all I want," said Ethra, dimpling with
delight. "I want to see how far I can go with
him just for the fun of it."</p>

<p>Miss Darrell smiled tenderly at the girl and
strolled off to join the other Regents; and Ethra,
her thoughtful eyes fixed on Langdon, came
slowly back, the yellow ribbon trailing in her
hand.</p>

<p>Langdon leaped to his feet to meet her, gazing
delightedly at the yellow ribbon.</p>

<p>"I qualified, of course!" he said joyously.
"When is it customary to begin the courting?"</p>

<p>"You haven't qualified," said the girl, watching
the effect of her words on the young man. "This
is merely the probation ribbon."</p>

<p>An immense astonishment silenced him. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
drew the big orange-coloured ribbon through his
button-hole, tied it into a bow, patted it out into
flamboyant smartness, and, stepping back, gazed
at him without any particular expression in her
dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Then, then I may be chased away at any moment?"
he asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so."</p>

<p>Thunderstruck, he stared at her: "What on
earth are we to do?" he groaned.</p>

<p>"<i>We?</i>"</p>

<p>"You and I?"</p>

<p>"How does it concern <i>me</i>?" asked the girl
coldly.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it?"</p>

<p>She looked him calmly in the eye and shook her
head.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Langdon. However, as you are to
remain here for a day or two under observation,
no doubt you will receive <i>some</i> attention."</p>

<p>"Ethra! Isn't it possible that you might learn
to care&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! That is no way to talk!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, I can't wait for you to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
"You <i>must</i> wait! You have nothing to say
about such things until some girl asks you. And
that isn't very likely. Those four perfectly handsome
young men have been here for weeks now,
and, although they have received lots of attention,
not one girl has yet made any of them an
actual declaration. The girls here are having
too good a time to do anything more serious than
a little fussing&mdash;just enough to frisk a kiss now
and then and keep the men amused&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is monstrous!" said Langdon, very red.
"When a man's really in love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Men are flirts&mdash;every one of
them!"</p>

<p>She laughed, made him a little gesture of adieu,
refused to let him follow her, and coolly sauntered
off among the trees, heedless of his remonstrances
at being left to himself.</p>

<p>He watched her until she disappeared, then,
with misgivings, walked toward a tennis court,
where the four men were playing a rather dawdling
and indifferent game and keeping a lively eye
out for the advent of some girl.</p>

<p>They appeared to be rather good-looking fel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>lows,
not in any way extraordinary, remarkable
neither for symmetry of feature nor of limb.</p>

<p>Langdon stood at the edge of the court looking
at them and secretly comparing their beauty with
such charms as he was shyly inclined to attribute
to himself. There could be no doubt that he compared
favourably with them. If he was some, they
were not so much.</p>

<p>One, a tall young fellow with blond, closely
clipped hair, nodded pleasantly to him, and presently
came over to speak to him.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are a new recruit. Glad to see
you. We're all anxious to have enough men captured
to get up two ball nines. My name is Reginald
Willett."</p>

<p>"Mine is Curtis Langdon."</p>

<p>"Come over and meet the others," said Willett
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Langdon followed him, and was presently on
excellent terms with James Carrick, De Lancy
Smith, and Alphonso W. Green, amiable, clean
cut, everyday young fellows.</p>

<p>To them he related the circumstances of his
capture, and they all laughed heartily. Then he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
told them that he was here merely on probation
for a day or two, na&iuml;vely displaying the yellow
ribbon.</p>

<p>Willett laughed. "Oh, that's all right. They
usually say that. We all came in on probation;
the Regents couldn't agree, and some girl always
swings the deciding vote as a special favour to
herself."</p>

<p>"You don't think they'll kick me out?"</p>

<p>"Not much!" laughed Willett. "First of all,
your captor would object&mdash;not necessarily for sentimental
reasons, but because she caught you; you
are hers, her game; she says to herself: 'A poor
thing, but mine own!' and hangs to you like grim
death. Besides, no woman ever lets any man loose
voluntarily. And women haven't changed radically,
Mr. Langdon. Don't worry; you can stay,
all right."</p>

<p>"Here comes Betty Challis," said Carrick, glancing
at Alphonso W. Green. "It's you for a stroll,
I guess."</p>

<p>Mr. Green looked conscious; more conscious
still when the pretty Miss Challis strolled up, presented
him with a bouquet, and stood for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
moments conversing with everybody, perfectly at
her ease. Other girls came up and engaged the
young men in lively conversation. Presently Miss
Challis made a play for hers:</p>

<p>"Would you care to canoe, Mr. Green?" she
asked casually, turning to him with a slight blush
which she could not control.</p>

<p>Green blushed, too, and consented in a low
voice.</p>

<p>As they were departing, Miss Vining rode up
on horseback, leading another horse, which De
Lancy Smith, at her request, nimbly mounted;
and away they galloped down a cool forest road,
everybody looking after them.</p>

<p>Miss Darrell cut out and roped Willett presently
and took him to walk in the direction of
a pretty cascade.</p>

<p>A charming girl, a Miss Trenor, arrived with
a hammock, book, and bon-bons, and led Carrick
away somewhere by virtue of a previous agreement,
and the remaining girls pretended not to
care, and strolled serenely off in pretty bunches,
leaving Langdon standing, first on one foot, then
on the other, waiting to be spoken to.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
Abandoned, he wandered about the tennis court,
kicking the balls moodily. Tiring of this, he sat
down under a tree and twirled his thumbs.</p>

<p>Once or twice some slender figure passed, glancing
brightly at him, and he looked as shyly receptive
as he could, but to no purpose. Gloom
settled over him; hunger tormented him; he gazed
disconsolately at the yellow ribbon in his button-hole,
and twiddled his thumbs.</p>

<p>And all the while, from the shadow of a distant
cave, Ethra was watching him with great content.
She knew he was hungry; she let him remain so.
By absent treatment she was reducing him to a
proper frame of mind.</p>

<p>The word had been passed that he was Ethra's
quarry; mischievous bright eyes glanced at him,
but no lips unclosed to speak to him; little feet
strolled near him, even lingered a moment, but
trotted on.</p>

<p>His sentiments varied from apathy to pathos,
from self-pity to mortification, from hungry despair
to an indignation no longer endurable.</p>

<p>He had enough of it&mdash;plenty. Anger overwhelmed
him; hunger smothered sentiment; he rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
in wrath and stalked off toward a girl who was
strolling along, reading a treatise on eugenics.</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to tell me how to
get out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Out?" she repeated. "Have you a pass to
go out?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. Where do I obtain one?"</p>

<p>"Only the girl who captured you can give you
a pass," she said, amused.</p>

<p>"Very well; where can I find her?"</p>

<p>"Who was it netted you?"</p>

<p>"A Miss Leslie," he snapped.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ethra Leslie's cave is over in those
rocks," said the girl, "among those leafy ledges."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said briefly, and marched off,
scowling.</p>

<p>Ethra saw him coming, and his stride and expression
scared her. Not knowing exactly what
to do, and not anticipating such a frame of mind
in him, she turned over in her hammock and pretended
to be asleep, as his figure loomed up in
the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>"Miss Leslie!" His voice was stentorian.</p>

<p>She awoke languidly, and did it very well, mak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>ing
a charming picture as she sat up in her hammock,
a trifle confused, sweet blue eyes scarcely
yet unclosed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon!" she exclaimed in soft surprise.</p>

<p>He looked her squarely, menacingly, in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "that all this is a grim
parody on the past when women did the waiting
until it was men's pleasure to make the next move.
I suppose that my recent appraisement parallels
the social inspection of a debutante&mdash;that my
present hunger is paying for the wistful intellectual
starvation to which men once doomed your
sex; that my isolation represents the isolation
from all that was vital in the times when women's
opportunities were few and restricted; that my
probation among you symbolises the toleration of
my sex for whatever specimen of your sex they
captured and set their mark on as belonging to
them, and on view to the world during good behaviour."</p>

<p>He stared at her flushed face, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The allegory is all right," he said, "but you've
cast the wrong man for the goat. I'm going."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
"Y-you can't go," she stammered, colouring
painfully, "unless I give you a pass."</p>

<p>"I see; it resembles divorce. My sex had to
give yours a cause for escape, or you couldn't
escape. And in here you must give me a pass to
freedom, or I remain here and starve. Is that
it?"</p>

<p>She crimsoned to her hair, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Give me that pass," he said.</p>

<p>"If I do every girl here will gossip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what they say. I'm going."</p>

<p>She sat very still in the hammock, eyes vacant,
chin on hand, considering. It was not turning
out as she had planned. She had starved him
too long.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon," she said in a low voice, "if it
is only because you are hungry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not; I'm past mere hunger. You disciplined
me because I took a human and natural
interest in the pretty inhabitants of this new
world. And I <i>told</i> you that I never would have
entered it except for you. But you made me pay
for a perfectly harmless and happy curiosity.
Well, I've starved and paid. Now I want to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span> . . . Either
I go or there'll be something doing&mdash;because
I won't remain here and go hungry
much longer."</p>

<p>"S-something&mdash;doing?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Exactly. With the first&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can go if you wish," she said, flushing
scarlet and springing out of the hammock.</p>

<p>He waited, jaws set, while she seated herself
at a table and wrote out the pass.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, in such a rage that he
could scarcely control his voice.</p>

<p>She may not have heard him; she sat rigid at
the table, looking very hard into space&mdash;sat motionless
as he took a curt leave of her, never turning
her head&mdash;listened to his tread as he strode
off through the ferns, then laid her brow between
snowy hands which matched the face that trembled
in them.</p>

<p>As for him, he swung away along the path by
which he had come, unstrung by turns, by turns
violently desiring her unhappiness, and again anticipating
approaching freedom with reckless satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then a strange buoyancy came over him as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
arrived in sight of the gate, where the red-haired
girl sat on a camp stool, yawning and knitting
a silk necktie&mdash;for eventualities, perhaps; perhaps
for herself, Lord knows. She lifted her grey eyes
as he came swinging up&mdash;deep, clear, grey eyes
that met his and presently seemed ready to answer
his. So his eyes asked; and, after a long interval,
came the reply, as though she had unconsciously
been waiting a long, long while for the question.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will wish to keep this," he said
in a low voice, offering her the pass. "You will
probably desire to preserve it under lock and key."</p>

<p>She rose to her slender height, took it in her
childish hands, hesitated, then, looking up at him,
slowly tore the pass to fragments and loosed them
from her palm into the current of the south wind
blowing.</p>

<p>"That does not matter," she said, "if you are
going to love me."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then she held
out her left hand. He took it; with her right
hand, standing on tiptoe, she reached up and unbarred
the gates. And they passed out together
into the infernal splendour of the sunset forest.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> riots in London culminated in an
episode so cataclysmic that it sobered
the civilised world. Young Lord
Marque, replying to a question in the House of
Lords, said: "As long as the British peerage can
summon muscular vigour sufficient to keep a
monocle in its eye and extract satisfaction from
a cigarette, no human woman in the British Empire
shall ever cast a bally ballot for any bally
purpose whatever. What!"</p>

<p>And the House of Lords rose to its wavering
legs and cheered him with an enthusiasm almost
loud enough to be heard above ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>But that unwise and youthful and masculine
defiance was the young man's swan-song. A male<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
suffragette rushed with the news to Miss Pondora
Bottomly; Lord Marque was followed as he left
the house; and that very afternoon he was observed
fleeing in a series of startled and graceful
bounds through Regent Park, closely pursued by
several ladies of birth, maturity, and fashion carrying
solid silver hair-brushes.</p>

<p><i>The Queen</i>, chronicling the somewhat intimate
and exclusive affair a week later, mentioned
that: "Among those present was the lovely Lady
Diana Guernsey wearing tweeds, leather spats,
and waving a Directoire Banner embroidered with
the popular device, 'Votes for Women,' in bright
yellow and bottle green on an old rose ground;"
and that she had far outdistanced the aged Marchioness
of Dingledell, Lady Spatterdash, the Hon.
Miss Mousely, the Duchess of Rolinstone, Baroness
Mosscroppe, and others; and that, when last
seen, she and the Earl of Marque were headed
westward. A week later no news of either pursuer
or pursued having been received, considerable
uneasiness was manifested in court and suffragette
circles, and it was freely rumoured that
Lady Guernsey had made a rather rash but thor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>oughly
characteristic vow that she would never
relinquish the trail until she had forced Lord
Marque to eat his own words, written in frosting
upon a plum cake of her own manufacture.</p>

<p>Marque may have heard of this vow, and perhaps
entertained lively doubts concerning Lady
Diana's abilities as a pastry cook. At any rate,
he kept straight on westward in a series of kangaroo-like
leaps until darkness mercifully blotted
out the picture.</p>

<p>Remaining in hiding under a hedge long enough
to realise that London was extremely unsafe for
him, he decided to continue west as far as the
United States, consoling himself with the certainty
that his creditors would have forced his emigration
anyway before very long, and that he might
as well take the present opportunity to pick out
his dollar princess while in exile.</p>

<p>But circumstances altered his views; the great
popular feminine upheaval in America was now
in full swing; the eugenic principle had been declared;
all human infirmity and degenerate imperfections
were to be abolished through marriages
based no longer upon sentiment and personal in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>clination,
but upon the scientific selection of mates
for the purpose of establishing the ideally flawless
human race.</p>

<p>This was a pretty bad business for Lord
Marque. The day after his arrival he was a witness
of the suffragette riots when the Mayor, the
Governor, and every symmetrical city, county,
and State official was captured and led blushing to
the marriage license bureau. He had seen the terrible
panic in Long Acre, where thousands of
handsome young men were being chased in every
direction by beautiful and swift-footed suffragettes.
From his window in the Hotel Astor he
had gazed with horror upon this bachelors' St.
Bartholomew, and, distracted, had retired under
his bed for the balance of the evening, almost losing
consciousness when a bell-hop knocked at his
door with a supply of towels.</p>

<p>Only one thought comforted him; the ocean
rolled majestically between the Lady Diana,
her pastry, and the last of the house of
Marque.</p>

<p>Never should that terrible and athletic young
woman discover his whereabouts if he had to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>main
away from London forever; never, never
would he eat that pastry!</p>

<p>As he lay under his bed, stroking his short
moustache and occasionally sneezing, he remembered
with a shudder his flight from those solid
silver hair-brushes through Regent's Park; he recalled
how, behind him, long after the heavier
feminine aristocracy had given up the chase, one
youthful, fleet, supple, and fearsome girl had hung
to his trail&mdash;a tall, lithe, incarnation of her goddess
namesake.</p>

<p>She had been too far away for him to distinguish
her features; only in Liverpool, where one
dark night he ventured out to buy a copy of the
<i>Queen</i> and eagerly read the details of the function,
did he learn the name of his closest pursuer.</p>

<p>Later, furtively haunting the smoking room on
the <i>Caramania</i>, he learned from the gossip there
of Lady Diana's vow that she would never rest
until Lord Marque had eaten her plum cake with
its frosted inscription&mdash;this inscription consisting
of the flippant words of his own rash speech delivered
in the upper house of Parliament.</p>

<p>Now, lying on his back under the bed, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
outside in Long Acre the dreadful work was going
on, he lighted a cigarette and pondered the situation.
He didn't believe that Lady Diana would
attempt to trail him to America. That was one
comfort. But, in view of the suffragette disturbances
going on outside his windows, he saw little
prospect of a dollar princess for the present.
Meanwhile, how was he to exist?</p>

<p>The vague and British convictions concerning
the rapid accumulation of wealth on a "ranch"
of any kind comforted Marque. He also believed
them.</p>

<p>And three months later he had managed to survive
a personal acquaintance with the following
episodes:</p>

<p>First, one large revolver bullet through hat
with request to answer affably when addressed by
white men.</p>

<p>Second, one infuriated cow.</p>

<p>Third, one indigestion incubated by cumulative
series of pie and complicated by attentions from
one large centipede.</p>

<p>Fourth, one contusion from a Montana boot
with suggestion concerning monocle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
Fifth, one 45-70 Winchester projectile severing
string of monocle, accompanied by laughter and
Navajo blanket.</p>

<p>Sixth, comprehensive corporal casualties incident
upon international altercation concerning relative
importance of Guy Fawkes and July 4th.</p>

<p>Seventh, physical debility due to excessive local
popularity following personal encounter with one
rustler.</p>

<p>Eighth, complete prostration in consequence of
frequent attempts to render thanks for toasts offered
him at banquet in celebration of his impending
departure for the East.</p>

<p>Ninth, general collapse following bump of coal
and forcible ejection from freight train near Albany,
New York.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> duties of young Lord Marque, the
new man on the Willett estate at Caranay,
left him at leisure only after six
o'clock, his day being almost entirely occupied in
driving a large lawn mower.</p>

<p>Life, for John Marque&mdash;as he now called himself&mdash;had
become exquisitely simple; eating, sleeping,
driving a lawn mower&mdash;these three manly
sports so entirely occupied the twenty-four hours
that he had scarcely time to do much weeding&mdash;and
no time at all to sympathise with himself because
he was too busy by day and too sleepy at
night.</p>

<p>Sundays he might have taken off for the pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>pose
of condoling with himself, had it not been
for the new telephone operator.</p>

<p>She was a recent incumbent at the railroad station&mdash;a
tall, clear-skinned, yellow-haired girl of
twenty-five who sat at her desk all day saying
in a low, prettily modulated voice, "hello&mdash;hello&mdash;hello&mdash;hello"
to unseen creatures of whom John
Marque wotted not.</p>

<p>Three things concerning her he had noticed:
She wore pink gingham; she never seemed to see
him when he came down to the little sunburnt platform
and seated himself on the edge, feet dangling
over the rails; he had never seen her except when
she was seated at the pine table which was ornamented
by her instrument and switchboard. She
had a bed-room and kitchen in the rear. But he
never saw her go into them or emerge; never saw
her except seated at her switchboard, either reading
or sewing, or, with the silvery and Greek-like
band encircling her hair and supporting the receiver
close to her small ears, repeating in her
low, modulated voice: hello&mdash;hello&mdash;hello&mdash;hello.</p>

<p>He wondered how tall she might be. He had
never seen her standing or walking. He won<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>dered
what her direct gaze might be like. Only
her profile had he yet beheld&mdash;a sweet, youthful,
profile nobly outlined under the gold of her hair;
but under the partly lowered lashes as she sat
sewing or reading or summoning centrals from
the vast expanses of North America, he divined
eyes of a soft lilac-blue. And he chewed his pipe-stem
and kicked his feet and thought about them.</p>

<p>Few trains stopped at Caranay except for water;
the station, an old-time farm house of small
dimensions, overlooking the track and Willow
Brook, contained ticket office, telephone, and telegraph
in one&mdash;all presided over by the telephone
operator. Sometimes as many as two people in a
week bought railroad tickets; sometimes a month
would pass without anybody either sending or receiving
a telegram. Telephone calls were a little
more frequent.</p>

<p>So the girl had little to do there at her sunny
open window, where mignonette and heliotrope
and nasturtiums bloomed in pots, and the big
bumble bees came buzzing and plundering the little
window garden. And, except on Sundays, Marque
had little leisure to observe her, although in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
long late June evenings it was still light at eight
o'clock, and he had, without understanding how
or why, formed the habit of coming down to the
deserted station platform to smoke his pipe and
sometimes to fish in the shallow waters of Willow
Brook, and watch the ripples turn from gold to
purple, and listen to a certain bird that sat singing
every day at sunset on the tip of a fir-balsam
across the stream&mdash;a black and white bird with a
rosy pink chest.</p>

<p>So lovely the evening song of this bird that
Marque, often watching the girl askance, wondered
that the surprising beauty of the melody never
caused her to lift her head from book or sewing,
or even rise from the table and come out to the
doorway to listen.</p>

<p>But she never did; and whether or not the bird's
singing appealed to her, he could not determine.</p>

<p>Nobody in the little gossiping hamlet of Caranay
seemed to know more than her name; he himself
knew only a few people&mdash;men who, like himself,
worked on the Willett place with hoe and
rake and spraying cart and barrow&mdash;comrades of
roller and mower and weed-fork and mole-trap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>&mdash;dull-witted
cullers of dandelion and rose-beetle.
And mostly their names were Hiram.</p>

<p>These had their own kind in the female line to
"go with"&mdash;Caranay being far from the metropolis,
and as yet untroubled by the spreading feminine
revolution. Only stray echoes of the doings
had as yet penetrated to Caranay daisy fields;
no untoward consequences had as yet ensued except
that old Si Dinglebat's wife, after reading
the remains of a New York paper found on the
railroad track, had suddenly, and apparently in
a fit of mental aberration, attacked Si with a mop,
accompanying the onslaught with the reiterated
inquiry: "Air wimmen to hev their rights?"</p>

<p>That was the only manifestation of the welt-weh
in Caranay&mdash;that and the other welt on Si's
dome-like and knobby forehead.</p>

<p>He encountered Marque that evening after supper
as that young man, in clean blue jeans, carrying
a fish-pole and smoking his pipe, was wandering
in circles preparatory to a drift in the
general direction of the railroad station.</p>

<p>"Evenin', neighbour!" he said.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the young man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
"Goin' sparkin'?" inquired Si, overflowing with
natural curiosity and tobacco.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Be you goin' a-sparkin'?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Marque, reddening. "I don't
know any girls in Caranay."</p>

<p>"Waal, I cal'late you know that gal down to
the depot, don't ye?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Hey? I'm a leetle deef."</p>

<p>"No!" shouted Marque, "I don't."</p>

<p>"Don't what?"</p>

<p>"Don't know her, dammit!"</p>

<p>"Aw, quit yer cussin'," said Si, with a gummy
wink. "Folks has been talkin' ever since the fustest
time you set onto that there platform and
that Eden gal fooled ye with her lookin' glass."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said Marque
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Issy Eden and her pretendin' not to see nobody&mdash;an'
her a lookin' into the leetle glass behind
her table and a seein' of ye all the time!
I know she kin see because she ketched Hi Orville's
boy a-hookin' apples outen the bar'l that&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
"You mean she is able to see <i>anybody</i> on the
platform," said Marque, confused and astounded.</p>

<p>"You bet she kin. I know because I peeked
in the winder an' I seen her a-lookin' at you when
you was fishin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the young fellow had recovered himself:
"All right," he interrupted; "that isn't your business
or mine. Who gave you that crack on the
lid?"</p>

<p>"By gum," he said, "Hetty done it. I was
that took! Forty year, and she ain't never throwed
s'much as a dish pan at me. I wa'n't lookin' for
no sech thing at my time o' life, young man. So
when I come in to wash up for supper, I sez to my
woman, 'Hello, Het,' sez I, an' she up an'
screeched an' fetched me a clip.</p>

<p>"'Lord a'mighty!' sez I. 'Look out what ye
doin',' sez I. 'Air wimmen to hev their rights?'
sez she, makin' for me some more. 'Is wimmen
to be free?' she sez.</p>

<p>"'Yew bet,' sez I, grabbin' onto her. 'I'll make
free with ye,' sez I. An' I up an' tuk an' spanked
Hetty&mdash;the first time in forty year, young man!
An' it done her good, I guess, for she ain't never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
cooked like she cooked supper to-night. God
a'mighty, what biscuits them was!"</p>

<p>Marque listened indifferently, scarcely following
the details of the domestic episode because
his mind was full of the girl at the station and the
amazing discovery that all these days she could
have seen him perfectly well at any moment if
she had chosen to take the trouble, without moving
more than her dark, silky lashes. Had she
ever taken that trouble? He did not know, of
course. He would like to have known.</p>

<p>He nodded absently to the hero of the welt-weh
clash, and, pipe in one hand, pole in the other,
walked slowly down the road, crossed the track,
and seated himself on the platform's edge.</p>

<p>She was at her desk, reading. And the young
man felt himself turning red as he realised that,
if she had chosen, she could have seen him sitting
here every evening with his eyes fixed&mdash;yes, sentimentally
fixed upon the back of her head and her
pretty white neck and the lovely contour of her
delicately curved cheek.</p>

<p>All by himself he sat there and blushed, head
lowered, apparently fussing with his line and hook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
and trying to keep his eyes off her, without much
success.</p>

<p>His angling methods were simple; he crossed
the grass-grown track, set his pole in position,
and returned to seat himself on the platform's
edge, where he could see his floating cork and&mdash;her.
Then, as usual, he relapsed into meditation.</p>

<p>If only just once she had ever betrayed the
slightest knowledge of his presence in her vicinity
he might, little by little, cautiously, and by degrees,
have ventured to speak to her.</p>

<p>But she never had evinced the slightest shadow
of interest in anything as far as he had noticed.</p>

<p>Now, as he sat there, the burnt out pipe between
his teeth, watching alternately his rod and
his divinity, the rose-breasted grosbeak began to
sing in the pink light of sunset. Clear, pure,
sweet, the song rang joyously from the tip of the
balsam's silver-green spire. He rested his head
on one hand and listened.</p>

<p>The song of this bird, the odour of heliotrope,
the ruddy sunlight netting the ripples&mdash;these, for
him, must forever suggest her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
He had curious fancies about her and himself.
He knew that, if she ever did turn and look at
him out of those lilac-tinted eyes, he must fall in
love with her, irrevocably. He admitted to himself
that already he was in love with all he could
see of her&mdash;the white neck and dull gold hair, the
fair cheek's curve, the glimpse of her hand as
she deliberately turned a page in the book she
was reading.</p>

<p>But that evening passed as had the others;
night came; she lowered her curtain; a faint tracery
of lamplight glimmered around the edges; and,
as always, he lighted his pipe and took his fish,
and shouldered his pole and went home to die the
little death we call sleep until the sun of toil should
glitter above the eastern hills once more.</p>

<p>A few days later he decided to make an ass
of himself, having been sent with a wagon to Moss
Centre, a neighbouring metropolis.</p>

<p>First he sent a telegram to himself at Caranay,
signing it William Smith. Then he went to the
drug store telephone, and called up Caranay.</p>

<p>"Hello! What number, please?" came a far,
sweet voice; and Marque trembled: "No number.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
I want to speak to Mr. Marque&mdash;Mr. John
Marque."</p>

<p>"He isn't here."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. I saw him driving one of Mr.
Willett's wagons across the track this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too bad. Could I&mdash;might I&mdash;ask
a little information of you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"What sort of a fellow is this John Marque?
He doesn't amount to much I understand."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, I might want to employ him, but I don't
believe he is the sort of man to trust&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken!" she said crisply.</p>

<p>"You mean he is all right?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Honest?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Capable?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Sober?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"M-moral?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>
"Unquestionably!" she said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I have means of information which I am not
at liberty to disclose. Who is this speaking?"</p>

<p>"William Smith of Minnow Hollow."</p>

<p>"Are you going to take Mr. Marque to Minnow
Hollow?"</p>

<p>"I may."</p>

<p>"You can't. Mr. Willett employs him."</p>

<p>"Suppose I offer him better wages&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is perfectly satisfied here."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! Mr. Marque does not care to leave Caranay."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sorry. It is useless to even suggest it to
him. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>With cheeks flushed and a slightly worried expression
she resumed her sewing through the golden
stillness of the afternoon. Now and then the
clank of wagon wheels crossing the metals caused
her to glance swiftly into her mirror to see what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
was going on behind her. And at last she saw
Marque drive up, cross the track, then, giving
the reins to the boy who sat beside him, turn and
walk directly toward the station. And her heart
gave a bound.</p>

<p>For the first time he came directly to her window;
she saw and heard him, knew he was waiting
behind the mignonette and heliotrope, and went
on serenely sewing.</p>

<p>"Miss Eden?"</p>

<p>She waited another moment&mdash;time enough to
place her sewing leisurely on the table. Then,
very slowly she turned in her chair and looked at
him out of her dark lilac-hued eyes.</p>

<p>He heard himself saying, as in a dream:</p>

<p>"Is there a telegram for me?"</p>

<p>And, as her delicate lifted brows questioned
him:</p>

<p>"I am John Marque," he said.</p>

<p>She picked up the telegram which lay on her
table and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. After he had gone she
realised that she had not spoken.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> he went to Moss Centre
with the wagon he telephoned and
telegraphed to himself, and about a
month after he had begun this idiot performance
he ventured to speak to her.</p>

<p>It occurred late in July, just before sunset.
He had placed his rod, lighted his pipe, and seated
himself on the platform's edge, when, all of a
sudden, and without any apparent reason, a dizzy
sort of recklessness seized him, and he got up
and walked over to her window.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
She looked around leisurely.</p>

<p>"Good evening," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I was wondering," he went on, scared almost
to death, "whether you would mind if I spoke
to you?"</p>

<p>After a few seconds she said:</p>

<p>"Well? Have you decided?"</p>

<p>Badly frightened, he managed to find voice
enough to express his continued uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Why did you care to speak to me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;we&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;" and he stuck fast.</p>

<p>"Had you anything to say to me?" she asked
in a lower&mdash;and he thought a gentler&mdash;voice.</p>

<p>"I've a lot to say to you," he said, finding his
voice again.</p>

<p>"Really? What about?"</p>

<p>He looked at her so appealingly, so miserably,
that the faintest possible smile touched her lips.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Marque?"</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if you'd only let me speak to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am letting you."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;to-morrow, too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow? To-morrow is a very, very long
way off. It is somewhere beyond those eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
hills&mdash;but a very, very long way off!&mdash;as far as
the East is from the West. No; I know nothing
about to-morrow, so how can I promise anything
to anybody?"</p>

<p>"Will your promise cover to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. . . . The sun has nearly set, Mr.
Marque."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps when to-morrow is to-day you
will be able to promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Have you caught any fish?"</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "How did you know
I was fishing? You didn't turn to look."</p>

<p>She said coolly: "How did you know I didn't?"</p>

<p>"You never do."</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>At her window, elbows on the sill, the blossoms
in her window-box brushing his sunburnt face, he
stood, legs crossed, pipe in hand, the sunset wind
stirring the curly hair at his temples.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the bird this evening?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't he a perfect darling!"</p>

<p>Her sudden unbending was so gracious, so sweet
that, bewildered, he remained silent for a while,
recovering his breath. And finally:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
"I never knew whether or not you noticed his
singing," he said.</p>

<p>"How could you suppose any woman indifferent
to such music?" she asked indignantly. She was
beginning to realise how her silence had starved
her all these months, and the sheer happiness of
speech was exciting her. Into her face came a
faint glow like a reflection from the pink clouds
above the West.</p>

<p>"That little bird," she said, "sings me
awake every morning. I can hear his happy,
delicious song above the rushing chorus of dawn
from every thicket. He dominates the cheery
confusion by the clear, crystalline purity of his
voice."</p>

<p>It scarcely surprised him to find himself conversing
with a cultivated woman&mdash;scarcely found
it unexpected that, in her, speech matched beauty,
making for him a charming and slightly bewildering
harmony.</p>

<p>Her slim hands lay in her lap sometimes; sometimes,
restless, they touched her bright hair or
caressed the polished instruments on the table before
her. But, happy miracle! her face and body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
remained turned toward him where he stood leaning
on her window-sill.</p>

<p>"There is a fish nibbling your hook, I think,"
she said.</p>

<p>He regarded his bobbing cork vaguely, then
went across the track and secured the plump perch.
At intervals during their conversation he caught
three more.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "I think I had better say
good-night."</p>

<p>"Would you let me give you my fish?"</p>

<p>She replied, hesitating: "I will let you give me
two if you really wish to."</p>

<p>"Will you bring a pan?"</p>

<p>"No," she said hastily; "just leave them under
my window when you go."</p>

<p>Neither spoke again for a few moments, until
he said with an effort:</p>

<p>"I have wanted to talk to you ever since I first
saw you. Do you mind my saying so?"</p>

<p>She shook her head uncertainly.</p>

<p>He lingered a moment longer, then took his
leave. Far away into the dusk she watched him
until the trees across the bridge hid him. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
the faint smile died on her lips and in her eyes;
her mouth drooped a little; she rested one hand
on the table, rose with a slight effort, and lowered
the shade. Listening intently, and hearing no
sound, she bent over and groped on the floor for
something. Then she straightened herself to her
full height and, leaning on her rubber-tipped cane,
walked to the door.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> came every day; and every day, at sundown,
she sat sewing by the window
behind her heliotrope and mignonette
waiting.</p>

<p>Sometimes he caught perch and dace and chub,
and she accepted half, never more. Sometimes he
caught nothing; and then her clear, humorous
eyes bantered him, and sometimes she even rallied
him. For it had come to pass in these sunset
moments that she was learning to permit herself
a friendliness and a confidence for him which was
very pleasant to her while it lasted, but, after he
had gone, left her with soft lips drooping and
gaze remote.</p>

<p>Because matters with her, with them both, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
feared, were not tending in the right direction.
It was not well for her to see him every day&mdash;well
enough for him, perhaps, but not for
her.</p>

<p>Some day&mdash;some sunset evening, with the West
flecked gold and the zenith stained with pink, and
the pink-throated bird singing of Paradise, and
the brook talking in golden tones to its pebbles&mdash;some
such moment at the end of day she would
end all of their days for them both&mdash;all of their
days for all time.</p>

<p>But not just yet; she had been silent so long,
waiting, hoping, trusting, biding her time, that
to her his voice and her own at eventide was a
happiness yet too new to destroy.</p>

<p>That evening, as he stood at her window, the
barrier of mignonette fragrant between them, he
said rather abruptly:</p>

<p>"Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No," she said startled.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am relieved."</p>

<p>"Why did you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because every Tuesday I have seen the doctor
from Moss Centre come in here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
In flushed silence she turned to her table and,
folding her hands, gazed steadily at nothing.</p>

<p>Marque looked at her, then looked away. The
big, handsome young physician from Moss Centre
had been worrying him for a long while now, but
he repeated, half to himself: "I am very much
relieved. I was becoming a little anxious&mdash;he
came so regularly."</p>

<p>"He is a friend," she said, not looking at him.</p>

<p>He forced a smile. "Well, then, there is no
reason for me to worry about you."</p>

<p>"There never was any reason&mdash;was there?"</p>

<p>"No, no reason."</p>

<p>"You don't say it cheerfully, Mr. Marque. You
speak as though it might have been a pleasure
for you to worry over my general health and
welfare."</p>

<p>"I think of little else," he said.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Between them, along the
barrier of heliotrope and mignonette, the little
dusk moths came hovering on misty wings; the sun
had set, but the zenith was bright crimson. Perhaps
it was the reflection from that high radiance
that seemed to tint her face with a softer carmine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
She looked out into the West across the stream,
thinking now that for them both the end of
things was drawing very near. And, to meet fate
half way with serenity&mdash;nay, to greet destiny
while still far off, with a smile, she unconsciously
straightened in her chair and lifted her proud
little head.</p>

<p>"Lord Marque," she said quietly, "why do you
not go back to England?"</p>

<p>For a moment what she had said held no meaning
for him. Then comprehension smote him like
lightning; and, thunderstruck, he remained as he
was without moving a muscle, still resting against
her window-sill, his lean, sun-browned face illuminated
under the zenith's fiery glory.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he said, under his breath.</p>

<p>"Only an English girl who happened to have
seen you in London."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>She turned deliberately and, resting one arm
across the back of her chair, looked him steadily
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"I am twenty-five. Since I was twenty your
face has been familiar to me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
They exchanged a long and intent gaze.</p>

<p>"I never before saw you," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"<i>Have</i> I?"</p>

<p>"Who can know what a fashionable young man
really looks at&mdash;through a monocle."</p>

<p>"I don't wear it any more. I lost it out West,"
he said, reddening.</p>

<p>"You lost your top hat once, too," she said.</p>

<p>He grew red as fire.</p>

<p>"So you've heard of that, too?"</p>

<p>"I saw it."</p>

<p>"You! Saw me attacked?" he demanded angrily,
while the shame burnt hotter on his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes. You ran like the devil."</p>

<p>For a moment he remained mute and furious;
then shrugged: "What was I to do?"</p>

<p>"Run," she admitted. "It was the only way."</p>

<p>He managed to smile. "And you were a witness
to that?"</p>

<p>She nodded, eyes remote, her teeth nipping at
the velvet of her underlip. He, too, remained
lost in gloomy retrospection for a while, but finally
looked up with a more genuine smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
"I wonder whatever became of that fleet-footed
girl who hung to my heels long after the more
solidly constructed aristocracy gave up?"</p>

<p>"Lady Diana Guernsey?"</p>

<p>"That's the one. What became of her?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because she gave me the run of my life. She
was a good sport, that girl. I couldn't shake her
off; I took to a taxi and she after me in another;
my taxi broke down in the suburbs and I started
across country, she after me. And the last I
saw of her was just after I leaped a hedge and
she was coming over it after me&mdash;a wonderful
athletic young figure in midair silhouetted against
the sky line. . . . That was the last I saw of her.
I fancy she must have pulled up dead beat&mdash;or
perhaps she came a cropper."</p>

<p>"She did," said the girl in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" he said, interested. "Hope it
didn't damage her."</p>

<p>"She broke her thigh."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too bad!" he exclaimed. "If I'd
guessed any such thing I'd have come back. . . . The
poor little thing! I mean that, though she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
was nearly six feet, I seem to think of her as little&mdash;and,
of course, I'm six&mdash;two and a half. . . . Good
little sport, that Diana girl! She got over
it all right, I hope."</p>

<p>"It lamed her for life, Lord Marque."</p>

<p>Shocked, for a moment he could find no words
to characterise his feelings. Then:</p>

<p>"Oh, dammitall! I say, it's a rotten shame,
isn't it? And all on account of me&mdash;that superb
young thing taking hedges like a hunter! Oh,
come now, you know I&mdash;it hurts me all the way
through. I wish I'd let her catch me! What
would she have done to me? I wouldn't mind being
pulled about a bit&mdash;or anything&mdash;if it would
have prevented her injury. By gad, you know,
I'd even have eaten her plum cake, frosting and
all, to have saved her such a fate."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes searched his. "That was not
the most tragic part of it, Lord Marque."</p>

<p>"God bless us! Was there anything more?"</p>

<p>"Yes. . . . She was in love with you."</p>

<p>"With&mdash;with <i>me</i>?" he repeated, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Yes. As a young, romantic girl she fell in
love with you. She was a curious child&mdash;like all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
the Guernseys, a strange mixture of impulse and
constancy, of romance and determination. If she
had fallen in love with Satan she would have remained
constant. But she only fell in love with
young Marque. . . . And she loves him to this
day."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that's utterly impossible!" he stammered.
"Didn't she become a suffragette and
carry a banner and chase me and vow to make
me eat my own words frosted on a terrible plum
cake?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And all the while she went on loving
you."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he demanded, incredulously.</p>

<p>"She confided in me."</p>

<p>"In <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"I knew her well, Lord Marque. . . . Not as
well as I thought I did, perhaps; yet, perhaps
better than&mdash;many&mdash;perhaps better than anybody. . . . We
were brought up together."</p>

<p>"You were her governess?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;attempted to act in a similar capacity. . . . She
was difficult to teach&mdash;very, very diffi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>cult
to govern. . . . I am afraid I did not do
my best with her."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave her to come here?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"Where is she now?"</p>

<p>She looked out into the cinders of the West,
making no answer.</p>

<p>He gazed at her in silence for a long time;
then:</p>

<p>"Is she really lame?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very?"</p>

<p>"It is hip disease."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but that can be cured!" he exclaimed.
"It is now perfectly curable. Why doesn't she
go to Vienna or to New York&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is going."</p>

<p>"She ought to lose no time!"</p>

<p>"She is going. She only learned the nature
of her trouble very recently."</p>

<p>"You mean she has been lame all this time
and didn't know what threatened her?"</p>

<p>"She was&mdash;too busy to ask. Finally, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
she did not get well, she called in a physician.
But she is a very determined girl; she refused to
believe what the physician told her&mdash;until&mdash;very
recently&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "are you in constant communication
with her?"</p>

<p>"Constant."</p>

<p>"Then tell her you know me. Tell her how
terribly sorry I am. Tell&mdash;tell her that I'll do
anything to&mdash;to&mdash;tell her," he burst out excitedly,
"that I'll eat her plum cake if that will do her
any good&mdash;or amuse her&mdash;or anything! Tell her
to bake it and frost it and fill it full of glue, for
all I care&mdash;and express it to you; and I'll eat
every crumb of that silly speech I made&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" she exclaimed. "Do you realise what
you're saying? Do you realise what you're offering
to do for a girl&mdash;a lame girl&mdash;who is already
in love with you?"</p>

<p>His youthful face fell.</p>

<p>"By gad," he said, "do you think I ought to
marry her? How on earth can I when I'm&mdash;I'm
dead in love with&mdash;somebody myself?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;in love?" she said faintly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
He gazed across the brook at the darkening
foliage.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said with a pleasant sort of hopelessness,
"but I fancy she cares for another man."</p>

<p>"W-why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"He comes to see her."</p>

<p>"Is that a reason?"</p>

<p>"She won't talk about him."</p>

<p>"When a woman won't talk about a man is it
always because she cares for him in <i>that</i> way?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>They had lifted their heads now, facing each
other in the violet dusk. Between them the scent
of heliotrope grew sweeter. He said:</p>

<p>"I've been all kinds of a fool. For all I know
women have as many rights on earth as men have.
All I wish is that the plucky girl who took that
hedge, banner in hand, were well and happy and
married to a really decent fellow."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;she loves you."</p>

<p>"And I"&mdash;he looked up, encountering her blue
eyes&mdash;"am already hopelessly in love. What shall
I do?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
She said under her breath: "God knows. . . . I
can not blame you for not wishing to marry
a lame girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't that!"</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't anyhow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would if I loved her!"</p>

<p>"You <i>couldn't</i>&mdash;love a&mdash;a cripple! It would
not be love; it would be pity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said slowly: "I wish that <i>you</i> were that
lame girl. Then you'd understand me."</p>

<p>For a while she sat bolt upright, clasped hands
tightening in her lap. Then, turning slowly
toward him, she said:</p>

<p>"I am going to say good-night. . . . And
thank you&mdash;for Diana's sake. . . . And I am
going to say more&mdash;I am going to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye! Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To New York."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Before I see you again."</p>

<p>"There is no train until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall drive to Moss Centre."</p>

<p>"Where that&mdash;that doctor lives&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
"Yes. I am going to New York with him,
Lord Marque."</p>

<p>He stood as though stunned for a moment; then
set his teeth, clenched his hands, and pulled himself
together.</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he said quietly. "And&mdash;I
wish you&mdash;happiness."</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand to him above the
heliotrope.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;wish it&mdash;to you&mdash;&mdash;" suddenly her voice
broke; again her teeth caught at her underlip like
a child who struggles with emotion. "You&mdash;<i>don't</i>
understand," she said. "Wait a little while before
you&mdash;come to any&mdash;unhappy&mdash;conclusions."</p>

<p>After a moment she made a slight effort to disengage
her hand&mdash;another&mdash;then turned in her
chair and dropped her head on the table, her right
hand still remaining in his. Presently he released
it; and she placed both hands on the edge of
the table and her forehead upon them.</p>

<p>"I am coming in," he said.</p>

<p>She straightened up swiftly at his words.</p>

<p>"Please don't!" she said in a startled voice,
still tremulous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
But he was gone from the dark window, and,
frightened, she bent over, caught up her walking
stick, and took one impulsive step toward the
door. And stood stock still in the middle of
the floor as he entered.</p>

<p>His eyes met hers, fell on the supporting cane;
and she covered her face with her left arm, standing
there motionless.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he breathed. "<i>You!</i>"</p>

<p>She began to cry like a child.</p>

<p>"I didn't want you to know," she wailed. "Oh,
I didn't want you to know. I thought there was
no use&mdash;no hope&mdash;until yesterday. . . . I&mdash;wanted
to go to New York with the doctor and
be made all sound and well again b-before&mdash;before
I let you love me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Diana&mdash;Diana!" he whispered, with his
arms around her. "Oh, Diana&mdash;Diana&mdash;my
little girl Diana!"</p>

<p>Which was silly enough, she being six feet&mdash;almost
as tall as he.</p>

<p>"Turn your back," she whispered. "I want to
go to my desk&mdash;and I can't bear to have you
see me walk."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
"You darling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! Please let them cure me first. . . . Turn
your back."</p>

<p>He kissed her hands, held her at arm's length
a second, then turned on his heel and stood motionless.</p>

<p>He heard her move almost noiselessly away;
heard a desk open and close; heard the chair by
the window move as she seated herself.</p>

<p>"Come here," she said in a curious, choked
voice.</p>

<p>He turned, went swiftly to her side.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" he said. "When did you bake
that cake?"</p>

<p>"Y-yesterday."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"B-because I was going away to New York
and would never perhaps see you again unless I
was entirely cured. And I meant to leave this
for you&mdash;so you would know that I had followed
you even here&mdash;so you would know I had made a
plucky try at you&mdash;through all these months&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you corker!"</p>

<p>"D-do you really mean it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
"Mean it! I tell you, Diana, you women put
it all over the lords of creation&mdash;or any lord
ever created! Mean it! You bet I do, sweetness!
I'll take back everything I ever said about women.
They're <i>the</i> real thing in the world! And the
best thing for the world is to let them run it!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;dear&mdash;&mdash;" she faltered, lifting her beautiful
eyes to him, "if men are going to feel <i>that</i>
way about it, we won't want to run anything at
all. . . . It was only because you wouldn't let
us that we wanted to."</p>

<p>He said in impassioned tones:</p>

<p>"Let the bally world run itself, Diana. What
do we care&mdash;you and I?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "we don't care now."</p>

<p>Then that rash and infatuated young man, losing
his head entirely, drew from his jeans a large
jack-knife, and, before she could prevent him,
he had sliced off an enormous hunk of plum cake
heavily frosted with his own words.</p>

<p>"Don't, dear!" she begged him. "I couldn't ask
<i>that</i> of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will!" he said, and bit into it.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she begged him; "please don't! I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
haven't had much experience with pastry. It may
give you dreadful dreams!"</p>

<p>"Let it!" he said. "What do I care for dreams
while you remain real! Diana&mdash;Diana&mdash;huntress
of bigger game than ever fled through the age of
fable!"</p>

<p>And he bolted a section of frosting and began
to chew vigorously upon another, while she
slipped both hands into his, regarding him with
tender solicitude.</p>

<p>"Have no fears for me, dearest," he said indistinctly;
"fortified by months of pie I dread
no food ever prepared by youth and beauty. Even
the secret dishes of the Medici&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John!"</p>

<p>"W-what, darling?"</p>

<p>"After all&mdash;I don't cook so badly."</p>

<p>So, in the gloaming, he swallowed the last crumb
and gathered her into his strong young arms, and
drew her golden head down close to his.</p>

<p>"Take it from me," he whispered, relapsing into
the noble idioms of his adopted country, "you're
all to the mustard, Diana; your eats were bully
and I liked 'em fine!"</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> situation in Great Britain was becoming
deplorable; the Home Secretary
had been chased into the Serpentine;
the Prime Minister and a dozen members
of Parliament had taken permanent refuge in the
vaults of the Bank of England; a vast army of
suffragettes was parading the streets of London,
singing, cheering, and eating bon-bons. Statues,
monuments, palaces were defaced with the words
"Votes for Women," and it was not an uncommon
sight to see some handsome young man rushing
distractedly through Piccadilly pursued by scores
of fleet-footed suffragettes of the eugenic wing
of their party, intent on his capture for the purposes
of scientific propagation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
No young man who conformed to the standard
of masculine beauty set by the eugenist suffragettes
was safe any longer. Scientific marriage
between perfectly healthy people was now a firmly
established principle of the suffragette propaganda;
they began to chase attractive young men
on sight with the avowed determination of marrying
them to physically qualified individuals of
their own sex and party, irrespective of social or
educational suitability.</p>

<p>This had already entailed much hardship; the
young Marquis of Putney was chased through
Cadogan Place, caught, taken away in a taxi, and
married willy-nilly to a big, handsome, strapping
girl who sold dumb-bells in the new American
department store. No matter who the man might
be professionally and socially, if he was young
and well-built and athletic he was chased on sight
and, if captured, married to some wholesome and
athletic young suffragette in spite of his piteous
protests.</p>

<p>"We will found," cried Mrs. Blinkerly Dank-some-Hankly
triumphantly, "a perfect human race
and teach it the immortal principles of woman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
rights. So, if we can't persuade Parliament to
come out for us, we'll take Parliament by the
slack of its degraded trousers, some day, and
throw it out!"</p>

<p>This terrible menace delivered in Trafalgar
Square was cabled to the <i>Outlook</i>, which instantly
issued its first extra; and New York, already in
the preliminary throes of a feminine revolution,
went wild.</p>

<p>That day the handsome young Governor of
New York, attended by his ornamental young Military
Secretary in full uniform, had arrived at the
Waldorf-Astoria to confer with the attractive
young Mayor of the metropolis concerning a bill
to be introduced into the legislature, permitting
the franchise to women under certain conditions.
And on the same day a monster suffragette parade
was scheduled.</p>

<p>Some provisions of the proposed measure, somehow
or other, had become known to the National
Federation of Women; and as the Governor, his
Military Secretary, and the Mayor sat in earnest
conference in a private room at the Waldorf,
the most terrible riot that New York ever saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
began on Fifth Avenue just as the head of the
parade, led by the suffragette band of 100 pieces,
arrived at the hotel.</p>

<p>The Governor, Mayor, and Secretary rushed
to the windows; acres of banners waved wildly
below; cheer after cheer rent the raw March atmosphere;
in every direction handsome young men
were fleeing, pursued by eugenists. Under their
very windows the shocked politicians beheld an
exceedingly good-looking youth seized by several
vigorous and beautiful suffragettes, dragged into
a taxi, and hurried away toward a scientific marriage,
kicking and struggling. This was nothing
new, alas. More than one attractive young man
had already been followed and spoken to in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Mr. Dill, president of the Board of Aldermen,
and the handsomest incumbent of the office that
the city ever beheld, had been courted so persistently
that, fearful of being picked up, he remained
in hiding disguised as a Broadway fortune teller,
where the Mayor came at intervals to consult him
on pretense of having his palms read.</p>

<p>But now the suffragettes threw off all restraint;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
men, frightened and confused, were being not only
spoken to on Fifth Avenue, but were being seized
and forcibly conducted in taxicabs toward the
marriage license bureau.</p>

<p>It was a very St. Bartholomew for bachelors.</p>

<p>"John," said the Governor to his capable young
Military Secretary, "take off that uniform. I'm
going to flee in disguise."</p>

<p>"What does your excellency expect me to flee
in&mdash;dishabille?" stammered the Military Secretary.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you flee in," said the Governor
bluntly; "but I will not have it said that
the Governor of the great State of New York was
seized by a dozen buxom eugenists and hurried
away to become the founder of a physically and
politically perfect race of politicians. Get out of
those gold-laced jeans!"</p>

<p>"I'll flee disguised as a chambermaid," muttered
the handsome, rosy-cheeked young Mayor. And
he rang for one.</p>

<p>While the Governor and his Secretary were exchanging
clothes they heard the Mayor in the
hallway arguing with a large German chamber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>maid
in an earnest and fatherly manner, punctuated
by coy screams from the maid.</p>

<p>By and by he came back to the room, perspiring.</p>

<p>"I bought her clothes," he said; "she'll throw
them over the transom."</p>

<p>The clothing arrived presently by way of the
transom; the Governor and the Secretary tried
to aid the Mayor to get into the various sections
of clothing, but as they all were bachelors and
young they naturally were not aware of the functions
of the various objects scattered over the
floor.</p>

<p>The Governor picked up a bunch of curls attached
to a cup-shaped turban swirl.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he said. "The girl has scalped
herself for your sake, John!"</p>

<p>"I bought that, too," said the Mayor, sullenly.
"Do you know which way it goes on, George?"</p>

<p>They fixed it so that two curls fell down and
dangled on either side of his Honour's nose.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unfortunate Military Secretary
had dressed in the top hat and cutaway of the
Governor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
He said huskily, "If I can't outrun them they'll
catch me and try to start raising statesmen."</p>

<p>"It's your duty to defend me," observed the
Governor.</p>

<p>"Yes, with my life, but not with my p-progeny&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you'd better run faster than you've ever
run in all your life," said the Governor coldly.</p>

<p>At that moment there came a telephone call.</p>

<p>"Lady at the desk to speak to the Governor,"
came a voice.</p>

<p>"Hello, who is it?" asked his excellency coyly.</p>

<p>"Professor Elizabeth Challis!" came a very
sweet but determined voice.</p>

<p>At the terrible name of the new President of
the National Federation of American Women the
Governor jumped with nervousness. Anonymous
letters had warned him that she was after him for
eugenic purposes.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked tremulously.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Federation I demand that
you instantly destroy the draft of that infamous
bill which you are preparing to rush through at
Albany."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
"I won't," said the Governor.</p>

<p>"If you don't," she said, "the committee on
eugenics will seize you."</p>

<p>"Let 'em catch me first," he replied, boldly;
and rang off.</p>

<p>"Now, John," he said briskly, "as soon as they
catch sight of you in my top hat and cutaway
they'll start for you. And I advise you to leg
it if you want to remain single."</p>

<p>The unfortunate Military Secretary gulped
with fright, buttoned his cutaway coat, crammed
his top hat over his ears, and gazed fearfully
out of the window, where in the avenue below the
riot was still in lively progress. Terrified young
men fled in every direction, pursued by vigorous
and youthful beauty, while the suffragette band
played and thousands of suffragettes cheered
wildly.</p>

<p>"Isn't it awful!" groaned the Mayor, arranging
the lace cap on his turban-swirl and shaking out
his skirts. "The police are no use. The suffragettes
kidnap the good-looking ones. Are you
ready for the sortie, Governor?"</p>

<p>The Governor in the handsome uniform of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
Military Secretary adjusted his sword and put
on the gold-laced cap. Then, thrusting the draft
of the obnoxious bill into the bosom of his tunic,
he strode from the room, followed by his Secretary
and the unfortunate Mayor, who attempted
in vain to avoid treading on his own trailing
skirts.</p>

<p>"George," said the Mayor, spitting out a curl
that kept persistently getting into his mouth every
time he opened it, "I'll be in a pickle unless I
can reach Dill's rooms. . . . Wait! There's a
pin sticking into me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too late," said the Governor; "it will spur
you to run all the faster. . . . Where is
Dill's?"</p>

<p>The Mayor whispered the directions, spitting
out his curl at intervals when it incommoded him;
the Governor walked faster to escape.</p>

<p>Down in the elevator they went, gazed at by
terror-stricken bell-hops and scared porters.</p>

<p>As the cheering and band playing grew louder
and more distinct the Secretary quailed, but the
Governor admonished him:</p>

<p>"You've simply <i>got</i> to save me," he said. "<i>Pro</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
<i>bono publico!</i> Come on now. Make a dash for
a taxi and the single life! One&mdash;two&mdash;three!"</p>

<p>The next moment the Secretary's top hat was
carried away by a brick; the Mayor's turban-swirl
went the same way, amid showers of confetti and
a yell of fury from a thousand suffragettes who
saw in his piteous attempt to disguise himself,
by aid of a turban-swirl, an insult to womanhood
the world over.</p>

<p>A perfect blizzard of missiles rained on the terrified
politicians; the Secretary and the Mayor
burst into a frantic canter up Thirty-fourth
Street, pursued by a thousand strikingly handsome
women. The Governor ran west.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor of the great State of New
York was now running up Broadway
with his borrowed sword between his legs
and his borrowed uniform covered with confetti&mdash;footing
it as earnestly as though he were running
behind his ticket with New York County yet to
hear from.</p>

<p>After him sped bricks, vegetables, spot-eggs,
and several exceedingly fashionable suffragettes,
their perfectly gloved hands full of horsewhips,
banners, and farm produce.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
But his excellency was now running strongly;
one by one his eager and beautiful pursuers gave
up the chase and fell out, panting and flushed
from the exciting and exhilarating sport, until,
at Forty-second Street, only one fleet-footed
young girl remained at his heels.</p>

<p>The order of precedence then shifted as follows:
First, the young and handsome Governor
running like a lost dog at a fair and clutching
the draft of the obnoxious bill to his gold-laced
bosom; second, one distractingly lovely young
girl, big, wholesome-looking, athletic, and pink of
cheeks, swinging a ci-devant cat by the tail as
menacingly as David balanced the loaded sling;
third, several agitated policemen whistling and
rapping for assistance; fourth, the hoi polloi of
the Via Blanca; fifth, a small polychromatic dog;
sixth, the idle wind toying carelessly with the dust
and refuse and hats and skirts of all Broadway.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-36.jpg"><img src="./images/ill-36_th.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">"Only one fleet-footed young girl remained at his heels."</p>

<p>This municipal dust storm, mingling with the
brooding metropolitan gasoline fog, produced a
sirocco of which no Libyan desert needed to be
ashamed; and it alternately blotted out and revealed
the interesting Marathonian procession, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>til
one capricious and suffocating flurry, full of
whirling newspapers and derbies, completely blotted
out the Governor and the young lady at his
heels.</p>

<p>And when, a moment later, the miniature tornado
had subsided into a series of playful sidewalk
eddys, only the policemen, the hoi polloi, and
the dog were still going; the Governor and the
beautiful suffragette had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>They had, it is true, chosen a very good time
and place for such an occult performance; Long
Acre at its busiest.</p>

<p>Several mounted policemen had now joined in
the frantic festivities. They galloped hurriedly
in every direction. The crowd cheered and pursued
the police, the small dog barked in eddying
circles till he resembled an expiring pinwheel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a curious thing had occurred; the
youthful Governor was now chasing the suffragette.
It occurred abruptly, and in the following
manner:</p>

<p>No sooner had the dust cloud spread a momentary
fog around the radiant young man&mdash;like
a hurricane eclipse of the sun&mdash;than he darted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
into the narrow and dark hallway of an old-fashioned
office building devoted to theatrical agencies,
all-night lawyers, and "astrologists," and
started up the stairs. But his unaccustomed
sword tripped him up, and as he fell flat with a
startling outcrash of accoutrements, there came
a flurry of delicately perfumed skirts, the type-written
papers were snatched from his gloved
hands, and the perfumed skirts went scurrying
away through the dusky corridor which ought to
have opened on the next cross street. And didn't.</p>

<p>After her ran the Governor, now goaded to
courage by the loss of his papers, and she, finding
herself in a cul-de-sac, turned at bay, launched
the cat at his head, and attempted to spring past
him. But he caught the whirling feline in one
white-gloved hand and barred her way with the
other; and she turned once more in desperation
to seek an egress which did not exist.</p>

<p>A flight of precipitate and rickety stairs led
upward into an obscurity rendered deeper by a
single gas jet burning low on the landing above.</p>

<p>Up this she sprang, two at a time, the young
man at her heels; up, up, passing floor after floor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
until a dirty skylight overhead warned her that
the race was ending.</p>

<p>On the top corridor there was a door ajar; she
sprang for it, opened it, tried to slam and lock
it behind her, then, exhausted, she shrank backward
into the room and sank into a red velvet
chair, holding the bunch of papers tightly to her
heaving breast.</p>

<p>There was another chair&mdash;a gilt one. Into it
fell his excellency, gasping, speechless, his spurred
and booted legs trailing, his borrowed uniform
all over confetti and dust from his tumble on the
stairs.</p>

<p>Minute after minute elapsed as they lay there,
fighting for breath, watching each other.</p>

<p>She was the first to stir; and instantly he
dragged himself to his feet, staggered over to the
door, locked it, dropped the key into his pocket,
returned to his chair, and collapsed once more.</p>

<p>After a few moments he glanced down at the
cat which he was still clutching. A slight shiver
passed over him, then, as he inspected it more
closely, over his features crept an ironical smile.</p>

<p>For the cat was not even a ci-devant cat; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
had never been a cat; it was only an imitation of
a defunct one made out of floss and chenille, like
a teddy-bear; and he smiled at her scornfully
and dangled it by its black and white tail.</p>

<p>"Pooh," he panted; "I suppose even your bricks
and vegetables and eggs were cotillion favours full
of confetti."</p>

<p>"They were," she admitted defiantly. "Which
did not prevent their serving their purposes."</p>

<p>"As what?"</p>

<p>"As symbols!"</p>

<p>"Symbols?" he retorted in derision.</p>

<p>"Yes, symbols! The three most ancient symbols
of an insulted people's fury&mdash;the egg, the
turnip, and the cat."</p>

<p>"<i>Mala gallina, malum ovum</i>," he laughed, adjusting
his sword and picking several streamers of
confetti from his tunic. "Did they hurl spot-eggs
in ancient Rome, fair maid?"</p>

<p>"They did; and cats&mdash;<i>ex necessitate rei</i>," she
observed with composure.</p>

<p>"<i>Ex nihilo felis fit</i>&mdash;a cat-fit for nothing," he
retorted, flippantly.</p>

<p>Half disdainfully she straightened out the slight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
disorder of her own apparel, still breathing fast,
and keeping tight hold of the bundle of papers.</p>

<p>"How soon are you going to let me have them?"
he asked good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"I can't permit you to leave this room until
you hand them to me."</p>

<p>"Then I shall never leave this room."</p>

<p>"You certainly shall not leave it until I have
those papers."</p>

<p>"Then I'll remain here all my life!" she said
defiantly.</p>

<p>"What do you expect to do when the people
who live here return?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her pretty shoulders, and presently
cast an involuntary and uneasy glance
around the room.</p>

<p>It was not a place to reassure any girl; gilt
stars were pasted all over walls and ceilings, where
also a tinsel sun and moon appeared. The constellations
were interspersed with bats.</p>

<p>The remaining decorations consisted of a cozy
corner, some pasteboard trophies, red cotton velvet
hangings, several plaster casts of human hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
and a frieze of half-burnt cigarettes along the
mantel-edge.</p>

<p>"Are you going to give me those papers?" he
repeated, secretly amused.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What do you expect to do with them?"</p>

<p>"Deliver them to Professor Elizabeth Challis,
President of the National Federation of Independent
Women of America."</p>

<p>"Is this a private enterprise of yours," he
asked curiously, "or just a&mdash;a playful impulse, or
the militant fruition of a vast and feminine conspiracy?"</p>

<p>She smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean to be impertinent, but I
shall not evade answering you, Captain Jones. I
am acting under orders."</p>

<p>"Betty's?" he inquired, flippantly.</p>

<p>"The orders of Professor Elizabeth Challis,"
she said, with heightened colour.</p>

<p>"Exactly. It <i>is</i> a conspiracy, then, complicated
by riot, assault, disorderly conduct, and highway
robbery&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You may call it what you choose."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
"Oh, I'll leave that to the courts."</p>

<p>She said disdainfully: "We recognize no
laws in the making of which we have had no
part."</p>

<p>"There's no use in discussing that," said the
Governor blandly; "but I'd like to know what you
suffragettes find so distasteful in that proposed
bill which the Mayor and&mdash;and the Governor of
New York have had drafted."</p>

<p>"It is reactionary&mdash;a miserable subterfuge&mdash;a
treacherous attempt to return to the old order of
things! A conspiracy to re-shackle, re-enslave
American womanhood with the sordid chains of
domestic cares! To drive her back into the kitchen,
the laundry, the nursery&mdash;back into the dark
ages of dependence and acquiescence and non-resistance&mdash;back
into the degraded epochs of sentimental
relations with the tyrant man!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward in her excitement and her
sable boa slid back as she made a gesture with
her expensive muff.</p>

<p>"Once," she said, "woman was so ignorant that
she married for love! Now the national revolt
has come. Neither sentiment nor impulse nor emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>tion
shall ever again play any part in our relations
with man!"</p>

<p>He said, trying to speak ironically: "That's
a gay outlook, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"The outlook, Captain Jones, is straight into
a glorious millennium. Marriage, in the future, is
to mean the regeneration of the human race
through cold-blooded selection in mating. Only
the physically and mentally perfect will hereafter
be selected as specimens for scientific propagation.
All others must remain unmated&mdash;<i>pro
bono publico</i>&mdash;and so ultimately human imperfection
shall utterly disappear from this world!"</p>

<p>Her pretty enthusiasm, her earnestness, the delicious
colour in her cheeks, began to fascinate
him. Then uneasiness returned.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said cautiously, "that the
Governor of New York has received anonymous
letters informing him that Professor Elizabeth
Challis considers him a proper specimen for the&mdash;the
t-t-terrible purposes of s-s-scientific p-p-propagation?"</p>

<p>"Some traitor in our camp," she said, "wrote
those letters."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
"It&mdash;it isn't true, then, is it?"</p>

<p>"What isn't true?"</p>

<p>"That the Governor of the great State of New
York is in any danger of being seized for any
such purpose?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with a curious veiled expression
in her pretty eyes, as though she were near-sighted.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "Professor Challis means to
seize him."</p>

<p>The Governor gazed at her, horrified for a moment,
then his political craft came to his aid, and
he laughed.</p>

<p>"What does she look like?" he inquired. "Is
she rather a tough old lady?"</p>

<p>"No; she's young and&mdash;athletic."</p>

<p>"Barrel-shaped?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's as tall as the Governor is&mdash;about
six feet, I believe."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he exclaimed, paling.</p>

<p>"Six feet," she repeated carelessly; "rowed
stroke at Vassar; carried off the standing long
jump, pole vault, and ten-mile swimming&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this is terrible," murmured the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
man, passing one gloved hand over his dampening
brow. Then, with a desperate attempt at a smile,
he leaned forward and said confidentially:</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, just between you and me,
the Governor is an invalid."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she retorted, her clear blue eyes
on his.</p>

<p>"Alas! It is only too true. He's got a very,
very rare disease," said the young man sadly.
"Promise you won't tell?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes," said the girl. Her face had lost some
of its colour.</p>

<p>"Then I will confide in you," said the young
man impressively. "The Governor is threatened
with a serious cardiac affection, known as Lamour's
disease."</p>

<p>She looked down, remained silent for a moment,
then lifted her pure gaze to him.</p>

<p>"Is that true&mdash;Captain Jones?"</p>

<p>"As true as that I am his Military Secretary."</p>

<p>Her features remained expressionless, but the
colour came back as though the worst of the shock
were over.</p>

<p>"I see," she said seriously. "Professor Challis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
ought to know of this sad condition of affairs. I
have heard of Lamour's disease."</p>

<p>"Indeed, she ought to be told at once," he said,
delighted. "You'll inform her, won't you?"</p>

<p>"If you wish."</p>

<p>"Thank you! <i>Thank</i> you!" he said fervently.
"You are certainly the most charmingly reasonable
of your delightful sex. The Governor will
be tremendously obliged to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is the Governor&mdash;are his&mdash;his affections&mdash;to
use an obsolete expression&mdash;fixed upon any particular&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he said, smiling; "the Governor isn't
in love&mdash;except&mdash;er&mdash;generally. He's a gay bird.
The Governor never, in all his career, saw a single
specimen of your sex which&mdash;well, which interested
him as much&mdash;well, for example," he added
in a burst of confidence, "as much even as you
interest me!"</p>

<p>"Which, of course, is not at all," she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no, not at all&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated, biting
his moustache and looking at her.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing," he said; "if the Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>ernor
ever did get entirely well&mdash;er&mdash;recovered&mdash;you
know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Cured of his cardiac trouble?&mdash;this disease
known as Lamour's disease?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. If he ever did recover, he&mdash;I'm
quite sure he would be&mdash;&mdash;" and here he hesitated,
gazing at her in silence. As for her, she had
turned her head and was gazing out of the window.</p>

<p>"I wonder what your name is?" he said, so
na&iuml;vely that the colour tinted even the tip of the
small ear turned toward him.</p>

<p>"My name," she said, "is Mary Smith. Like
you, I am Militant Secretary to Professor Elizabeth
Challis, President of the Federation of American
Women."</p>

<p>"I hope we will remain on pleasant terms," he
ventured.</p>

<p>"I hope so, Captain Jones."</p>

<p>"Non-combatants?"</p>

<p>"I trust so."</p>

<p>"Even f-friends?"</p>

<p>She bent her distractingly pretty head in acquiescence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
"Then you'll give me back the papers?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry for taking them?"</p>

<p>"No, sorry for keeping them."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you are going
to keep them, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I must. My duty forces me to
deliver them to Professor Challis."</p>

<p>"But why does this terrible and strapping
young lady desire to swipe the draft of this bill?"</p>

<p>"Because it contains the evidence of a wicked
conspiracy between the Governor of New York,
the Mayor of this city, and an abandoned legislature.
The women of America ought to know
what threatens them before this bill is perfected
and introduced. And before they will permit it
to be debated and passed they are determined to
march on Albany, half a million strong, as did
the heroines of Versailles!"</p>

<p>She stretched out her white gloved hand with
an excited but graceful gesture; he eyed her moodily,
swinging the chenille cat by its fluffy tail.</p>

<p>"What do they suspect is in that bill?" he
said at last.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
"We are not yet perfectly sure. We believe
it is an insidious attempt to sow dissension in the
ranks of our sex&mdash;a bill cunningly devised to
create jealousy and unworthy distrust among us&mdash;an
ingenious and inhuman conspiracy to disorganize
the National Federation of Free and Independent
Women."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said. "The bill, when perfected,
is designed to give you what you want."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly; votes for women."</p>

<p>"On what terms?" she asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Terms? Oh, no particular terms. I wouldn't
call them 'terms,'" he said craftily; "that sounds
like masculine dictation."</p>

<p>"It certainly does."</p>

<p>"Of course. There are no terms in it. It's
a&mdash;a sort of a civil service idea&mdash;a kind of a
qualification for the franchise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued pleasantly, "it a&mdash;er&mdash;suggests
that a vote be accorded to any woman who,
in competition with others of that election district,
passes the examinations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
"<i>What</i> examinations?"</p>

<p>He twirled the cat carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, the examination papers are on various subjects.
One is chemistry."</p>

<p>"Chemistry?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that part of organic chemistry which
includes the scientific preparation of&mdash;er&mdash;food."</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed; he twirled the cat absently.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "chemistry is one of the subjects.
Physics is another&mdash;physical phenomena."</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the&mdash;the proposition that nature abhors
a vacuum. You're to prove it&mdash;you're given a
certain area&mdash;say a bed-room full of dust. Then
you apply to it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," she said; "you mean we apply to it
a vacuum cleaner, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Or," he admitted courteously, "you may solve
it through the science of dynamics&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;using a broom." Her eyes were
beautiful but frosty.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, as pleasantly as he
dared, "that you, for instance, would be sure to
pass."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
"Because I'm intelligent enough to comprehend
the subtleties of this&mdash;bill?"</p>

<p>"Exactly." He swung the cat in a circle.</p>

<p>"Thank you. And what else do these examination
papers contain?"</p>

<p>"Physics mostly&mdash;the properties of solid bodies.
For example, you choose a button&mdash;any ordinary
button," he explained frankly, as though taking
her into his confidence; "say, for instance, the
plain bone button of commerce&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And sew it onto some masculine shirt," she
nodded as he sank back apparently overcome with
admiration at her intelligence. "And that," she
added, "no doubt is intended to illustrate the phenomenon
of adhesion."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly correct," he said with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"What else is there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing very much. A few experiments
in bacteriology&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sterilizing nursing bottles?"</p>

<p>"How on earth did you ever guess?" he cried,
overwhelmed, but perfectly alert to the kindling
anger in her blue eyes. "Why, of course that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
it. It is included in the science of embryotics&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What science?"</p>

<p>"Embryotics. For instance, you take an embryo
of any kind&mdash;say a&mdash;a baby. Then you
show exactly how to dress, undress, wash, feed,
and finally bring that baby to triumphant maturity.
It's interesting, isn't it, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>She said nothing. He twirled the cat furiously
until its tail gave way and it flew into a corner.</p>

<p>"Captain Jones," she said, "as I understand it,
this bill is a codified conspiracy to turn every
woman of this State into a&mdash;a washer of clothes,
a cleaner of floors, a bearer of children&mdash;and a
Haus-frau!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would not put it <i>that</i> way," he protested.</p>

<p>"And her reward," she went on, not noticing
his interruption, "is permission to vote&mdash;to use
the inalienable liberty with which already Heaven
has endowed her."</p>

<p>Tears flashed in her eyes; she held her small
head proudly and not one fell.</p>

<p>"Captain Jones," she said, "do you realize what
centuries of suppression are doing to my sex? Do
you understand that woman is degenerating into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
an immobility&mdash;an inertia&mdash;a molluskular condition
of receptive passivity which is rendering us,
year by year, more unfitted to either think or
act for ourselves? Even in the matter of marriage
we are not permitted by custom to assume
the initiative. We may only shake our heads until
the man we are inclined toward asks us, when
he is entirely ready to ask. Then, like a row of
Chinese dolls, we nod our heads. I tell you,"
she said, tremulously, "we are becoming like that
horrid, degenerate, wingless moth which is born,
mates, and dies in one spot&mdash;a living mechanical
incubator&mdash;a poor, deformed, senseless thing that
has through generations lost not only the use, but
even the rudiments of the wings which she once
possessed. But the male moth flies more strongly
and frivolously than ever. There is nothing the
matter with the development of <i>his</i> wings, Captain
Jones."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now growing rather dark in the room.</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry you feel this way," he said.</p>

<p>She had averted her eyes and was now seated,
chin in hand, looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "this is a rotten condition
of affairs."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"This attitude of women."</p>

<p>"Is it more odious than the attitude of men?"</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "man is born with the
biceps. He was made to do the fighting."</p>

<p>"Not all of the intellectual fighting."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
"No, of course not. But&mdash;you don't want him
to rock the cradle, do you?"</p>

<p>"Cradles are no longer rocked, Captain Jones.
I don't think <i>you</i> would be qualified to pass this
examination with which you menace us."</p>

<p>He began to be interested. She turned from
the window, saw he was interested, hesitated,
then:</p>

<p>"I wish I could talk to you&mdash;to such a man as
you seem to be&mdash;sensibly, without rancour, without
personal enmity or prejudice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. <i>I</i> can. But&mdash;I am not sure what
<i>your</i> attitude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is friendly," he said, looking at her. "I
am perfectly hap&mdash;I mean willing to listen to
you. Only, sooner or later, you must return to
me those papers."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The Governor entrusted them to me officially&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said smiling: "But you&mdash;your Governor
I mean&mdash;can frame another similar bill."</p>

<p>"I'm a soldier in uniform," he said dramati<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>cally.
"My duty is to guard those papers with
my life!"</p>

<p>"I am a soldier, too," she said proudly, "in
the Army of Human Progress."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "if you regard it that
way."</p>

<p>"I do. Only brute violence can deprive me of
these papers."</p>

<p>"That," he said, "is out of the question."</p>

<p>"It is no more shameful than the mental violence
to which you have subjected us through centuries.
Anyway, you're not strong enough to get
them from me."</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to seize you and twist your
arm until you drop those papers?"</p>

<p>"You can never have them otherwise. Try it!"</p>

<p>He sat silent for a while, alternately twisting
his moustache and the cat's tail. Presently he
flung the latter away, rose, inspected the stars
on the wall, and then began to pace to and fro,
his gloved hands behind his back, spurs and sword
clanking.</p>

<p>"It's getting late," he said as he passed her.
Continuing his promenade he added as he passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
her again. "I've had no luncheon. Have you?"</p>

<p>He poked around the room, examining the fantastic
furnishings in all their magnificence of cotton
velvet and red cheesecloth.</p>

<p>"If this is Dill's room it's a horrible place,"
he thought to himself, sitting down by a table and
shuffling a pack of cards.</p>

<p>"Shall I cast your horoscope?" he asked amiably.
"Here's a chart."</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Presently he said: "It's getting beastly cold
in this room."</p>

<p>"Really!" she murmured.</p>

<p>He came back and sat down in the gilded chair.
It was now so dusky in the room that he couldn't
see her very plainly.</p>

<p>So he folded his arms and abandoned himself
to gloomy patience until the room became very
dark. Then he got up, struck a match, and lighted
the gas.</p>

<p>"By Jupiter!" he muttered, "I'm hungry."</p>

<p>For nearly five minutes she let the remark go
apparently unnoticed. But the complaint he had
made is the one general and comprehensive appeal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
that no woman ever born can altogether ignore.
In the depths of her something always responds,
however faintly. And in the soul of this young
girl it was answering now&mdash;the subtle, occult response
of woman to the eternal and endless need
of man&mdash;hunger of one kind or another.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, so sincerely that the
sweetness in her voice startled him.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, do you know I believe you really
are!" he said in grateful surprise.</p>

<p>"I am a great many things that you have no
idea I am," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"What is one of them?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm a&mdash;a fool."</p>

<p>She came forward and stood looking at him.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," she said, "that I can do
you no kinder service than to destroy those papers
and let you go home."</p>

<p>For a moment he thought she was joking, then
something in her expression changed his opinion
and he took a step forward, eyes fixed on her face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it would be the kindest thing
you can do for me. Shall I tell you why? It's
because I'm hopelessly near-sighted. I wear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
glasses when I'm alone in my study, where nobody
can see me."</p>

<p>"What in the world has <i>that</i> to do with my
leaving you?" she asked, colouring up.</p>

<p>"Suffragettes would never marry a near-sighted
man, would they?"</p>

<p>"They ought not to."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> wouldn't, would you?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask&mdash;such a thing?"</p>

<p>"I want to know."</p>

<p>"But how does your myopia concern <i>me</i>?" she
said faintly.</p>

<p>"<i>Couldn't</i> it&mdash;ever?" he asked, reddening.</p>

<p>"No," she said, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Then we'd better not stay here; and I'm going
to be as generous as you are," he said, advancing
toward her. "I'm going to let you go
home."</p>

<p>She backed away, thrusting the papers behind
her; his arm slipped around her, after them, strove
to grasp them, to hold and restrain her, but there
was a strength in her tall, firm young body which
matched his own; she resisted, turned, twisted, confronted
him with high colour, and lips compressed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>
and they came to a deadlock, breathing fast and
irregularly.</p>

<p>Again, coolly, dexterously, he pitted his adroitness,
then his sheer strength against hers; and it
came again to a deadlock.</p>

<p>Suddenly she crook'd one smooth knee inside of
his; her arms slid around him like lightning; he
felt himself rising into the air, descending&mdash;there
came a crash, a magnificent display of ocular
fireworks, and nothing further concerned him until
he discovered himself lying flat on the floor
and heard somebody sobbing incoherencies beside
him.</p>

<p>He was mean enough to keep his eyes shut
while she, on her knees beside him, slopped water
on his forehead and begged him to speak to her,
and told him her heart was broken and she desired
to die and repose in mortuary simplicity beside
him forever.</p>

<p>Certain terms she employed in addressing what
she feared were only his mortal remains caused
him to prick up his ears. He certainly was one
of the meanest of men.</p>

<p>"Dear," she sobbed, "I&mdash;I have l-loved you ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
since your lithographs were displayed during the
election! Only speak to me! Only open those
beloved eyes! I don't care whether they are near-sighted!
Oh, please, please wake up!" she cried
brokenly. "I'll give you back your papers. What
do I care about that old bill? I'm p-perfectly
willing to do all those things! Oh, oh, oh! How
conscience does make Haus-fraus of us all!"</p>

<p>His meanness now became contemptible; he felt
her trembling hands on his brow; the fragrant,
tearful face nearer, nearer, until her hot, flushed
cheeks and quivering lips touched his. And yet,
incredible as it seems, and to the everlasting shame
of all his sex, he kept eyes and mouth shut until
a lively knocking on the door brought him bolt
upright.</p>

<p>She uttered a little cry and shrank away from
him on her knees, the tears glimmering in her
startled and wide open eyes.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, darling!" he said seriously;
"how on earth are we going to explain this?"</p>

<p>They scrambled hastily to their feet and gazed
at each other while kicks and blows began to rain
on the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
"I believe it's Dill," he whispered; "and I seem
to hear the Mayor's voice, too."</p>

<p>"Help! Help! For heaven's sake!" screamed
the Mayor, "let us in, George! There's a mob
of suffragettes coming up the stairs!"</p>

<p>The Governor unlocked the door and jerked
it open, just as several unusually beautiful girls
seized Mr. Dill and the Military Secretary.</p>

<p>The Mayor, however, rushed blindly into the
room, his turban-swirl was over one eye, his skirt
was missing, his apron hung by one pin.</p>

<p>He ran headlong for a sofa and tried to scramble
under it, but lovely and vigorous arms seized his
shins and drew him triumphantly forth.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" they cried delightedly, "we have carried
the entire ticket!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" echoed a sweet but tremulous voice,
and a firm young arm was slipped through the
Governor's.</p>

<p>He turned to meet her beautiful, level gaze.</p>

<p>"Check!" she said.</p>

<p>"Make it check-mate," he said steadily.</p>

<p>"Mate <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
She bent her superb head a moment, then lifted
her splendid eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Of course I will," she said, as steadily as her
quickening heart permitted. "Why do you suppose
I ran after you?"</p>

<p>"Why?" whispered that infatuated man.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, na&iuml;vely, "I was afraid some
other girl would get you. . . . A girl never can
be sure what another girl might do to a man. . . . And
I wanted you for myself."</p>

<p>"Thank God," he said, "that six-foot Professor
Challis will never get me, anyway."</p>

<p>She bent her adorable face close to his.</p>

<p>"Your excellency," she murmured, "<i>I</i> am Professor
Challis!"</p>

<p>At that instant a pretty and excited suffragette
dashed up the stairs and saluted.</p>

<p>"Professor," she cried, "all over the city desirable
young men are being pursued and married
by the thousands! We have swept the State, with
Brooklyn and West Point yet to hear from!" Her
glance fell upon the Governor; she laughed glee-fully.</p>

<p>"Shall I call a taxi, Professor?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
An exquisite and modest pride transformed the
features of Professor Betty Challis to a beauty
almost celestial.</p>

<p>"Let George do it," she said tenderly.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> minutes later, amid a hideous scene
of riot, where young men were fleeing
distractedly in every direction, where
excited young girls were dragging them, struggling
and screaming, into cabs, where even the police
were rushing hither and thither in desperate
search for a place to hide in, the Governor of
New York and Professor Elizabeth Challis might
have been seen whirling downtown in a taxicab
toward the marriage license bureau.</p>

<p>Her golden head lay close to his; his moustache
rested against her delicately flushed cheek. A mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>ment
later she sat up straight in dire consternation.</p>

<p>"Oh, those papers! The draft of the bill!" she
exclaimed. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Did you want it, Betty?" he asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, no. Didn't you want it, George?"</p>

<p>"I? Not at all."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth did you keep me imprisoned
in that room so long if you didn't want those
papers?"</p>

<p>He said slowly: "Why didn't you give them
up to me if <i>you</i> didn't really want them,
Betty?"</p>

<p>She shook her pretty head. "I don't know. . . . But
I'm afraid it was only partly obstinacy."</p>

<p>"It was only partly that with me," he said.</p>

<p>They smiled.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to detain you, I suppose," he admitted.</p>

<p>"George, you wouldn't expect me to match that
horrid confession&mdash;would you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't ask it of you."</p>

<p>He laid his cheek against hers and whispered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
"Darling, do you think our great love justifies
our concealing my myopia?"</p>

<p>"George," she murmured, "I think it does. . . . Besides,
I'm dreadfully near-sighted myself."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Dear, every one of us has got <i>something</i> the
matter with her. Miss Vining, who caught the
Mayor, wears a rat herself. . . . Do you mean
to say that men believe there ever was a perfect
woman?"</p>

<p>He kissed her slowly. "<i>I</i> believe it," he said.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the extremes of fashionable feminine
costume appear first on Fifth Avenue
in late November, and in early December
are imitated in Harlem, and finally in January
pervade the metropolitan purlieus, so all the great
cities of the Union, writhing in the throes of a
fashionable suffragette revolution, presently inoculated
the towns; and the towns infected the
villages, and the villages the hamlets, and the hamlets
passed the contagion along into the open
country, where isolated farms and dicky-birds
alone remained uninfected and receptive.</p>

<p>It was even asserted by enthusiastic suffragettes
that flocks of feminine dicky-birds had begun to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
assault masculine birds of the same variety; and
that the American landscape was full of agitated
male birds, lacking rear plumage, flying distractedly
in every direction or squatting disconsolately
in lonely trees, counting their tail feathers.</p>

<p>Mr. Borroughs and our late great President
were excitedly inclined to believe it, but the most
famous and calm of explorers, who had recently
returned from exile to his camp on top of Mt.
McKinley, warned the scientific world on a type-writer
not to credit anything that anybody said
until he had corroborated it in the magazines.
And he left that week for another trip to the
pole to find out what the attitude of the polecats
might be concerning the matter in question.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cities were full of trouble and
forcibly selected bridegrooms. From 60,000 marriages
recorded in New York City for the twelve
months of the previous year, in the few months of
the eugenic revolution the number of weddings had
reached the enormous figures of 180,000, not including
Flatbush.</p>

<p>Thousands and thousands of marriageable
young men were hiding in their clubs or in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
shrubbery of Central Park, waiting for a chance
to make their escape to the country and remain
incognito in hay lofts until the eugenic revolution
had ended itself in a dazzling display of divorce.</p>

<p>Westchester, the Catskills, and even the country
farther north were full of young business men and
professional men fleeing headlong from their jobs
in Wall Street, Broadway, and Fifth Avenue, and
hiring out to farmers and boarding house keepers
under assumed names. One could jump a
young man out of almost any likely thicket north
of the Bronx; they were as plentiful and as shy
as deer in the Catskills; corn field, scrub, marsh,
and almost any patch of woods in the State, if
carefully beaten up, would have yielded at least
one or two flocks of skulking young men.</p>

<p>Now, as there was no close season, and marriageable
youths in New York City became
scarcer, those militant suffragettes devoted to eugenic
principles began to make excursions into
the suburbs in search of bevies and singles&mdash;which
had escaped the exciting days of the great Long
Acre drive and the bachelors' St. Bartholomew.
And, as the April days turned into May days, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
the May days into June days, parties of pretty,
laughing, athletic girls penetrated farther and
farther into the country, joyously rummaging the
woods and routing out and scattering into flight
the lurking denizens. For every den had its denizen,
and Diana roamed the earth once more.</p>

<p>There was excellent sport to be had along the
Hudson. Some young ladies went in automobiles;
some in yachts; some by train, to points north,
where the landscape looked more promising and
wilder&mdash;but probably not as wild as the startled
masculine countenances peering furtively from
hillside thickets as some gay camping party of
distractingly pretty girls appeared, carrying as
excess baggage one clergywoman and a bundle of
marriage licenses, with the bridegroom's name represented
only by a question mark.</p>

<p>It was on an unusually beautiful day in early
June that two briar-mangled and weather-beaten
young men, bearing every evidence of Wall Street
and excessive fright, might have been seen sitting
up like a brace of startled rabbits in a patch of
ferns which grew along the edges of a brook at
the foot of a charmingly wooded slope among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
Westchester hills. In every direction stretched
hills, woods, and Italians. The calm remote sky
was blue and unvexed by anything except factory
smoke; not a sound was visible, not a noise was
to be seen.</p>

<p>Bacon was frying unctuously in a pan on the
coals beside them; their suit-cases lay near. They
sat up in the fern patch, coffee cups suspended,
eyes wild, listening intently.</p>

<p>"Brown," whispered Vance, "did you hear anything
except the hum of automobiles?"</p>

<p>"I sure did," nodded Brown, craning his neck
like a turkey in a briar-patch and glaring around.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if they've got dogs," said Vance, "they'll
flush us before&mdash;hark! Great guns! <i>Look</i> at
that bench show!"</p>

<p>Brown's hair rose on end. "They <i>have</i> got
dogs," he whispered, "a toy bull, a Mexican, a
Chow, two Pomms&mdash;and, by Jupiter! they've got
a marmoset! Look at 'em! Hark! You can
hear those unnatural girls laughing! Me for a
quick getaway. Come on!"</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they may come from some college," faltered
Vance; "they may run us down. Shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
we trust to our protective colouring and squat
close?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to stay here until that miserable
Chow comes poking his orange-coloured head
into the ferns and laughs at us with his blue
tongue?"</p>

<p>Vance wrung his hands, hurling coffee all over
Brown in his agonised indecision.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he moaned. "I don't <i>want</i>
to be married! I can't afford it! Do you think
those girls can outrun us?"</p>

<p>"If they can," said Brown, "they'll want me
more than I want my liberty. Look out! There's
their bat-eared bull! See him sniff! The wretched
mutt has winded the bacon! We've got to make
a break for it now! Come on! Beat it, son!"</p>

<p>Up out of the covert crashed the two young
fellows, and went prancing away through the
woods, suit-cases in hand. A chorus of excited
yelps and barks greeted the racket they made in
their flight; a shrill whistle rang out, then a pretty
and excited voice:</p>

<p>"Mark! Quick, Gladys! There are two of
them! Mark left!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
"Are they any good?" cried Gladys. "Oh,
where are they, dear?"</p>

<p>"I only caught a glimpse of them. They looked
like fine ones, in splendid condition. Millicent!
Quick, where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here!" came a third voice. "Oh, Constance!
one is too perfectly splendid for anything! Chow-Chow
is at his heels! Look out! Mark right!"</p>

<p>"Run!" panted Constance, leaping a fallen log.</p>

<p>The lovely June woodland was now echoing
with the happy cries of the chase, the ki-yi of excited
lap-dogs, the breathless voices of the young
girls, the heavy crashing racket of stampeding
young men rushing headlong through bramble and
thicket with a noise like a hurricane amid dead
leaves.</p>

<p>Vance's legs, terror weakened, wobbled as he
fled; and after ten minutes he took to a tree with
a despairing scream.</p>

<p>Brown, looking back from the edge of a mountain
pasture, saw the dogs leaping frantically at
his friend's legs as he shinned rapidly up the
trunk, and disappeared into the clustering foliage;
saw three flushed young girls come running up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
with cries of innocent delight; saw one of them
release a slender, black, furry, spidery thing which
immediately ran up the tree; heard distracted yells
from Vance:</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, take away that marmoset!
I can't bear 'em&mdash;I hate 'em, ladies! Ouch! He's
all over me! He's trying to get into my pocket!
Take him away, for the love of Mike, and I'll
come down!"</p>

<p>But Brown waited to hear no more. Horror
now lent him her infernal wings; he fairly fluttered
across the mountain side, sailed down the
farther slope, and into a lonely country road.
Along this he cantered, observed only by surprised
cattle, until, exhausted, he slackened his pace to a
walk.</p>

<p>Rickety fences and the remains of old stone
walls flanked him on either hand; the clearings
were few, the cultivated patches fewer. He encountered
no houses. On a distant hillside stood
a weather-beaten barn, the sky shining blue
through its roof rafters.</p>

<p>Beyond this the road forked; one branch narrowed
to a grassy cattle path and presently ended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
at a pair of bars. Inside the bars was a stone
barn; beside the barn a house of the century before
last&mdash;a low, square stone house, half stripped
of its ancient stucco skin, a high-roofed one-story
affair, with sagging dormers peering from the
slates and little oblong loop-holes under the eaves,
from which the straw of birds' nests fluttered in
the breeze.</p>

<p>Surely this ancient place, even if inhabited&mdash;as
he saw it was&mdash;must be sufficiently remote from
the outer world to insure his safety. For here
the mountain road ended at the barn-yard bars;
here the low wooded hills walled in this little world
of house, barn, and orchard, making a silent,
sunny place under the blue sky, sweet with late
lilac bloom and the hum of bees. No factory
smoke was visible, no Italians.</p>

<p>He looked at the aged house. A black cat sat
on the porch thoughtfully polishing her countenance
with the back of one paw. Three diminutive
parti-coloured kittens frisked and rolled and
toddled around her; and occasionally she seized
one and washed it energetically against the grain.</p>

<p>Brown looked at the door with its iron knocker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
at the delicately spread fan-light over it, at the
side-lights, at the half-pillars with their Ionic capitals,
at the ancient clumps of lilacs flanking the
stone step&mdash;great, heavy-stemmed and gnarled old
bushes now all hung with perfumed clusters of
palest lavender bloom.</p>

<p>Leaning there on the picket fence he inhaled
their freshness, gazing up into the sunny foliage
of the ancient trees, elms, maples, and one oak so
aged and so magnificent that, awed, his eyes turned
uneasily again toward the house to reassure himself
that it was still inhabited.</p>

<p>Cat and kittens were comfortable evidence, also
a hen or two loitering near, and the pleasant
sound from a dozen bee-hives, and a wild rose in a
china bowl, dimly visible on an inner window-sill.</p>

<p>There were two characters he might assume;
he might go to the back door and request a job;
he might bang on the front door with that iron
knocker, shaped like a mermaid, and ask for country
board.</p>

<p>Of one thing, somehow or other, he was convincing
himself; this crumbling house and its occupants
knew as much about the recent high-jinks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
in New York as did the man who built it in the
days when loop-holes were an essential part of
local architecture, and the painted Sagamore
passed like a spectre through the flanking forests.</p>

<p>So Brown, carrying his suit-case, opened the
gate, walked up the path, seized the knocker, and
announced himself with resolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> he waited the cat looked up
at him, curiously but pleasantly.
"Hello, old lady," he said; and she
arched her back and rubbed lightly against his
nigh leg while the kittens tumbled over his shoes
and played frantically with the frayed bottoms of
his trousers.</p>

<p>This preliminary welcome seemed to comfort
him out of all proportion to its significance; he
gazed complacently about at the trees and flowers,
drew in deep breaths of the lilac's fragrance, and
waited, listening contentedly for the coming foot-fall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
He had not heard it when the door opened and
a young girl appeared on the threshold, standing
with one hand resting on the inner knob; the
other touching the pocket of her apron, in which
was a ball of yarn stuck through with two needles.</p>

<p>She was slim and red-haired and slightly
freckled, and her mouth was perhaps a shade
large, and it curled slightly at the corners; and
her eyes were quite perfectly made, except that
one was hazel-brown and the other hazel-grey.</p>

<p>Hat in hand, Brown bowed; and then she did a
thing which interested him; she lifted the edges
of her apron between slender white thumbs and
forefingers and dropped him the prettiest courtesy
he had ever seen off the stage.</p>

<p>"I came to inquire," he said, "whether you ever
take summer boarders."</p>

<p>"What are boarders?" she asked. "I never
heard of them except in naval battles."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven," he thought; "this is remote,
all right; and I have discovered pristine innocence
in the nest."</p>

<p>"Modern boarders," he explained politely, "are
unpleasant people who come from the city to en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>joy
the country, and who, having no real homes,
pay farmers to lodge and feed them for a few
days of vacation and dyspepsia."</p>

<p>"You mean is this a tavern?" she asked, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I mean, will you let me live here
a little while as though I were a guest, and then
permit me to settle my reckoning in accordance
with your own views upon the subject?"</p>

<p>She hesitated as though perplexed.</p>

<p>"Suppose you ask your father or mother," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"They are absent."</p>

<p>"Will they return this morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly when they expect to return."</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't you assume the responsibility?"
he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a few moments, and it
seemed to him as though, in the fearless gravity
of her regard, somehow, somewhere, perhaps in
the curled corners of her lips, perhaps in her
pretty and unusual eyes, there lurked a little demon
of laughter. Yet it could not be so; there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
were only serenity and a child's direct sweetness
in the gaze.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"John Brown 4th."</p>

<p>"Mine is Elizabeth Tennant. Where do you
live?"</p>

<p>"In&mdash;New York," he admitted, watching her
furtively.</p>

<p>"I was there once&mdash;at a ball&mdash;many years ago,"
she observed.</p>

<p>"Not <i>very</i> many years ago, I imagine," he said,
smiling at her youthful reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Many, many years ago," she said thoughtfully.
"I shall go again some day."</p>

<p>"Of course," he murmured politely, "it's a
thing to do and get done&mdash;like going abroad."</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>"Years ago I knew a boy&mdash;with your easy humour
and your trick of speech. He resembled
you otherwise; and he wore your name becomingly."</p>

<p>He tried to recall knowing her in his extreme
youth, but made no definite connection.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't remember," she said gravely;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
"but I think I know you now. Who is your
father?"</p>

<p>"My father?" he repeated, surprised and smiling.
"My father is John Brown 3rd."</p>

<p>"And his father?"</p>

<p>"My grandfather?" he asked, very much
amused. "Oh, he was John Brown 2nd. And <i>his</i>
father was Captain John Brown of Westchester;
but I don't want to talk D. A. R. talk to you
about my great grandfather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He fought at Pound Ridge," said the girl,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Brown, astonished.</p>

<p>"Tarleton's cavalry&mdash;the brutal hussars of the
legion&mdash;killed him on the Stamford Road," she
said; "and he lay there in the field all day
with one dead arm over his face and his
broken pistol in his hand, and the terrible galloping
fight drove past down the stony New Canaan
road&mdash;and the smoke from the meeting house
afire rolled blacker and blacker and redder and
redder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a quickly drawn breath she covered her
face with both hands and stood a moment silent;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
and Brown stared at her, astonished, doubting his
eyes and ears.</p>

<p>The next moment she dropped her hands and
looked at him with a tremulous smile.</p>

<p>"What in the world can you be thinking of
me?" she said. "Alone in this old house, here
among the remoter hills of Westchester. I live
so vividly in the past that these almost forgotten
tragedies seem very real to me and touch me closely.
To me the present is only a shadow; the past
is life itself. Can you understand?"</p>

<p>"I see," he said, intensely relieved concerning
her mental stability; "you are a Daughter of the
American Revolution or a Society of Colonial
Wars or&mdash;er&mdash;something equally&mdash;er&mdash;interesting
and desirable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am a Daughter of the American Revolution,"
she said proudly.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he smiled with an inward shudder.
"A&mdash;a very interesting&mdash;er&mdash;and&mdash;exceedingly&mdash;and&mdash;all
that sort of thing," he nodded amiably.
"Don't take much interest in it myself&mdash;being a
broker and rather busy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sorry."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
He looked up quickly and met her strange eyes,
one hazel-grey, one hazel-brown.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll be delighted to take an interest in anything
you&mdash;in&mdash;er&mdash;this Revolutionary business if
you&mdash;if you don't mind telling me about it," he
stammered. "Evenings, now, if you have time to
spare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She smiled, opened the door wider, and looked
humorously down at him where he stood fidgeting
on the step.</p>

<p>"Will you come in?" she asked serenely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> went, first depositing his suit-case on
the step outside by the cats, and followed
her into a large, comfortable sitting
room.</p>

<p>"By jove," he said, "you know this is really
mighty pretty! What a corking collection of old
furniture! Where in the world did you find&mdash;or
perhaps this is the original furniture of the
place?"</p>

<p>She said, looking around the room as though
slightly perplexed: "This furniture was made to
order for me in Boston."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
"Then it isn't genuine," he said, disappointed.
"But it's a very clever imitation of antique colonial.
It is really a wonderful copy."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is a copy."</p>

<p>"It certainly doesn't look like it; but it must
be if it was made in Boston for you. They're
ingenious fellows, these modern makers of colonial
furniture. Every antique shop in New York is
loaded up with excellent copies of this sort&mdash;only
not nearly as well done."</p>

<p>She assented, apparently with no very clear understanding
of what he meant.</p>

<p>"What a charming setting this old house makes
for such things," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded, looking doubtfully at the rag carpet.</p>

<p>"The Manor House was much finer," she observed.
"Come to the window and I'll show you
where it stood. They were fine folk, the Lockwoods,
Hunts, and Fanchers."</p>

<p>They rose and she laid one pretty hand on his
sleeve and guided him into a corner of the window,
where he could see.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said uneasily, "there is a main trav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>elled
road! I thought that here we were at the
very ends of civilisation!"</p>

<p>"That is the Bedford road," she said. "Over
there, beyond those chestnuts, is the Stamford
road. Can you see those tall old poplars? Beyond
the elms I mean&mdash;there&mdash;where the crows
are flying?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Eight tall poplars."</p>

<p>"The Manor House stood there. Tarleton
burnt it&mdash;set it afire with all its beautiful furniture
and silver and linen! His hussars ran
through it, setting it afire and shooting at the
mirrors and slashing the silks and pictures! And
when the Major's young wife entered the smoking
doorway to try to save a pitiful little trinket
or two, an officer&mdash;never mind who, for his descendants
may be living to-day in England&mdash;struck
her with the flat of his sword and cut
her and struck her to her knees! That is the
truth!"</p>

<p>He said politely: "You are intensely interested
in&mdash;er&mdash;colonial and revolutionary history."</p>

<p>"Yes. What else have I to think of&mdash;here?"</p>

<p>"I suppose many interesting memories of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
times cluster around this old place," he said, violently
stifling a yawn. He had risen early and
run far. Hunger and slumber contended for his
mastery.</p>

<p>"Many," she said simply. "Just by the gate
yonder they captured young Alsop Hunt and sent
him away to the Provost Prison in New York.
In the road below John Buckhout, one of our
dragoons, was trying to get away from one of
Tarleton's dragoons of the 17th Regiment; and
the British trooper shouted, 'Surrender, you
damned rebel, or I'll blow your brains out!' and
the next moment he fired a bullet through Buckhout's
helmet. 'There,' said the dragoon, 'you
damned rebel, a little more and I should have
blown your brains out!' 'Yes, damn you,' replied
John, 'and a little more and you wouldn't have
touched me!'"</p>

<p>Brown looked at her amused and astonished to
hear such free words slip so eagerly from a mouth
which, as he looked at it, seemed to him the sweet
mouth of a child.</p>

<p>"Where did <i>you</i> ever hear such details?" he
asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>
"People told me. Besides, the house is full of
New York newspapers. You may read them if
you wish. I often do. Many details of the fight
are there."</p>

<p>"Reading such things out of old newspapers
published at the time certainly must bring those
events very vividly before you."</p>

<p>"Yes. . . . It is painful, too. The surprise
and rout of Sheldon's 2nd dragoons&mdash;the loss of
their standard; the capture, wounding, and death
of more than two score&mdash;and&mdash;oh! that young
death there in the wheat! the boy lying in the
sun with one arm across his face and the broken
pistol in his hand! and his wife&mdash;the wife of a
month&mdash;dragging him back to this house&mdash;with
the sunset light on his dead face!"</p>

<p>"To <i>this</i> house?"</p>

<p>She dropped her hand lightly on his shoulder
and pointed.</p>

<p>"Tarleton's troopers came stamping and cursing
in by that very door after they had burned
Judge Lockwood's and the meeting house&mdash;but
they left her alone with her dead, here on the floor
where you and I are standing. . . . She was only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
seventeen; she died a few months later in child-birth.
God dealt very gently with her."</p>

<p>He looked around him in the pleasant light of
the room, striving to comprehend that such things
had happened in such a sleepy, peaceful place.
Sunlight fell through the curtains, casting the
wild roses' shadow across the sill; the scent of
lilacs filled the silence.</p>

<p>"It's curious&mdash;and sad," he said in a low voice.
"How odd that I should come here to the very
spot where that old ancestor of mine died&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was only twenty when he died," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"I know. But somehow a fellow seems to think
of any ancestor as a snuffy old codger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was very handsome," she said, flushing up.</p>

<p>There was a silence; then she looked around at
him with a glint of humour in her pretty eyes&mdash;one
hazel-brown, one hazel tinged with grey; and
the delicious mouth no longer drooped.</p>

<p>"Can't you imagine him as young as you are?
gay, humorous, full of mischievous life, and the
love of life? something of a dandy in his uniform&mdash;and
his queue tied smartly &agrave; la Fran&ccedil;aise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>!&mdash;gallant&mdash;oh,
gallant and brave in the dragoon's
helmet and jack-boots of Sheldon's Horse! Why,
he used to come jingling and clattering into this
room and catch his young wife and plague and
banter and caress her till she fled for refuge, and
he after her, like a pair of school children released&mdash;through
the bed-rooms, out by the kitchen, and
into the garden, till he caught her again in the
orchard yonder and held her tight and made her
press her palms together and recite:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4"><i>I love thee</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>I love thee</i></p>
<p><i>Through all the week and Sunday</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;until for laughing and folly&mdash;I&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>To his amazement her voice broke; into her
strange eyes sprang tears, and she turned swiftly
away and went and stood by the curtained window.</p>

<p>"Well, by gad!" he thought, "of all morbid
little things! affected to tears by what happened
to somebody else a hundred and thirty odd years
ago! Women are sure the limit!"</p>

<p>And in more suitable terms he asked her why
she should make herself unhappy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
She said: "I <i>am</i> happy. It is only when I am
here that I am lonely and the dead past lives again
among these wooded hills."</p>

<p>"Are you not&mdash;usually&mdash;here?" he asked, surprised.
"I thought you lived here."</p>

<p>"No. I live elsewhere, usually. I am too unhappy
here. I never remain very long."</p>

<p>"Then why do you ever come here?" he asked,
amused.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I am very happy elsewhere.
But&mdash;I come. Women do such things."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly understand why."</p>

<p>"A woman's thoughts return eternally to one
place and one person. <i>One</i> memory is her ruling
passion."</p>

<p>"What is that memory?"</p>

<p>"<i>The Place and the Man.</i>"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean that a woman, in spirit, journeys eternally
to the old, old rendezvous with love; makes,
with her soul, the eternal pilgrimage back to the
spot where Love and she were first acquainted.
And, moreover, a woman may even leave the man
with whom she is happy to go all alone for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
while back to the spot where first she knew happiness
because of him. . . . You don't understand,
do you?"</p>

<p>Brown was a broker. He did <i>not</i> understand.</p>

<p>She looked at him, smiling, sighing a little&mdash;and,
in spite of her fresh and slender youth&mdash;and
she was certainly not yet twenty&mdash;he felt curiously
young and crude under the gentle mockery
of her unmatched eyes&mdash;one hazel-brown, one hazel
tinged with grey.</p>

<p>Then, still smiling wisely, intimately to herself,
she went away into an inner room; and through
the doorway he saw her slim young figure moving
hither and thither, busy at shelf and cupboard.
Presently she came back carrying an old silver
tray on which stood a decanter and a plate of
curious little cakes. He took it from her and
placed it on a tip-table. Then she seated herself
on the ancient sofa, and summoned him to a place
beside her.</p>

<p>"Currant wine," she said laughingly; "and old-fashioned
cake. Will you accept&mdash;under this roof
of mine?"</p>

<p>He was dreadfully hungry; the wine was mild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
and delicious, the crisp cakes heavenly, and he ate
and ate in a kind of ecstasy, not perfectly certain
what was thrilling him most deeply, the wine
or the cakes or this slender maid's fresh young
beauty.</p>

<p>On one rounded cheek a bar of sunlight lay,
gilding the delicate skin and turning the curling
strands of hair to coils of fire.</p>

<p>He thought to himself, with his mouth a trifle
fuller than convention expects, that he would not
wish to resist falling in love with a girl like this.
<i>She</i> would never have to chase him very far. . . . In
fact, he was perfectly ready to be captured
and led blushing to the altar.</p>

<p>Once, as he munched away, he remembered the
miserable fate of his late companion Vance, and
shuddered; but, looking around at the young girl
beside him, his fascinated eyes became happily enthralled,
and matrimony no longer resembled
doom.</p>

<p>"What are these strange happenings in New
York of which I hear vague rumours?" she enquired,
folding her hands in her lap and looking
innocently at him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>
His jaw fell.</p>

<p>"Have <i>you</i> heard about&mdash;what is going on in
town?" he asked. "I thought you didn't know."</p>

<p>"They say that the women there are ambitious
to govern the country and are even resolved to
choose their own husbands."</p>

<p>"Something of that sort," he muttered uneasily.</p>

<p>"That is a very strange condition of affairs,"
she murmured, brooding eyes remote.</p>

<p>"It's a darned sight worse than strange!" he
blurted out&mdash;then asked pardon for his inelegant
vehemence; but she only smiled dreamily and
sipped her currant wine in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Shall we talk of something pleasanter?" he
said, still uneasy, "&mdash;er&mdash;about those jolly old
colonial days. . . . That's rather an odd gown
you wear&mdash;er&mdash;pretty you know&mdash;but&mdash;<i>is</i> it not
in the style of&mdash;er&mdash;those days of&mdash;of yore&mdash;and
all that?"</p>

<p>"It was made then."</p>

<p>"A genuine antique!" he exclaimed. "I suppose
you found it in the garret. There must be a
lot of interesting things up there behind those
flat loop-holes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
"Chests full," she nodded. "We save everything."</p>

<p>He said: "You look wonderfully charming in
the costume of those days. It suits you so perfectly
that&mdash;as a matter of fact, I didn't even notice
your dress when I first saw you&mdash;but it's a
<i>wonder</i>!"</p>

<p>"Men seldom notice women's clothes, do
they?"</p>

<p>"That is true. Still, it's curious I didn't notice
such a gown as that."</p>

<p>"Is it <i>very</i> gay and fine?" she asked, colouring
deliciously. "I love these clothes."</p>

<p>"They are the garments of perfection&mdash;robing
it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a gallant thing to say to me. . . . Do
you truly find me so&mdash;so agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Agreeable! You&mdash;I don't think I'd better say
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg you!"</p>

<p>"May I?"</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-43.jpg"><img src="./images/ill-43_th.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">"'Pray, observe my unmatched eyes.'"</p>

<p>Her cheeks and lips were brilliant, her eyes
sparkling; she leaned a trifle toward him, frail
glass in hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
"May not a pretty woman listen without offense
if a gallant man praises her beauty?"</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> exactly that&mdash;a beauty!" he said excitedly.
"The most bewitching, exquisite, matchless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg of you, be moderate," she laughed&mdash;and
picked up a fan from somewhere and spread
it, laughing at him over its painted edge.</p>

<p>"Pray, observe my unmatched eyes before you
speak again of me as matchless."</p>

<p>"Your eyes <i>are</i> matchlessly beautiful!&mdash;more
wonderfully beautiful than any others in all the
world!" he cried.</p>

<p>Yet the currant wine was very, very mild.</p>

<p>"Such eyes," he continued excitedly, "are the
most strangely lovely eyes I ever saw or ever shall
see. Nobody in all the world, except you, has such
eyes. I&mdash;I am going quite mad about them&mdash;about
you&mdash;about everything. . . . I&mdash;the plain
fact is that I love&mdash;such eyes&mdash;and&mdash;and every
harmonious and lovely feature that&mdash;that b-b-belongs
to them&mdash;and to&mdash;to <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>She closed her painted fan slowly, slowly left
her seat, took from the blue bowl on the window-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>sill
the wild rose blooming there, turned and looked
back at him, half smiling, waiting.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, scarcely knowing now
what he was about; she waited, tall, slender, and
fresh as the lovely flower she held.</p>

<p>Then, as he came close to her, she drew the wild
rose through the lapel of his coat, and he bent
his head and touched his lips to the blossom.</p>

<p>"When she and you&mdash;and Love&mdash;shall meet at
last, you will first know her by her eyes," she
began; and the next instant the smile froze on her
face and she caught his arm in both hands and
clung there, white to the lips.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Listen</span>!" she whispered; "did you hear
that?"</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, dazed.</p>

<p>"On the Bedford road! do you hear the horses?
Do you hear them running?"</p>

<p>"W-what horses?"</p>

<p>"Tarleton's!" she gasped, pressing her white
face between her hands. "Can't you hear their
iron scabbards rattle? Can't you hear their bugle
horn? Where is Jack? <i>Where</i> is Jack?"</p>

<p>A flurry of mellow music burst out among the
trees, followed by a loud report.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" she whispered, "the British!"</p>

<p>Brown stared at her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
"Why, that's only an automobile horn&mdash;and
their tire just blew out," he began, astonished.</p>

<p>But she sprang past him, calling, "Jack! Jack!
Where are you?" and he heard the door fly open
and her childish cry of terror outside in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The next second he followed her, running
through the hall and out through the door to
the porch; and at the same moment a big red
touring car came to a standstill before the house;
the chauffeur descended to put on a new tire, and
a young girl in motor duster and hood sprang
lightly from the tonneau to the tangled grass. As
she turned to look at the house she caught sight
of him.</p>

<p>Brown took an uncertain step forward; and she
came straight toward him.</p>

<p>Neither spoke as they met face to face. He
looked at her, passed his hand over his eyes, bewildered,
and looked again.</p>

<p>She was slim and red-haired and slightly
freckled, and her mouth was perhaps a shade
large, and it curled slightly at the corners, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>
her eyes were quite perfectly made except that
one was hazel-brown and the other a hazel-grey.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and it seemed to him as
though, in the fearless gravity of her regard,
somewhere, somehow&mdash;perhaps in the curled corners
of her lips, perhaps in her pretty and unusual
eyes&mdash;there lurked a little demon of laughter.
Yet it could not be so&mdash;there were only serenity
and a child's direct sweetness in her gaze.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have come to look at this old-time
place?" she said. "People often come. You
are perfectly welcome."</p>

<p>And, as he made no answer:</p>

<p>"If you care to see the inside of the house I
will be very glad to show it to you," she added
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it <i>yours</i>?" he managed to say, "or&mdash;or
your sister's?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "You mistake me for somebody
else. I have no sister. This is the old Brown
place&mdash;a very, very old house. It belonged to
my great grandmother. If you are interested I
will be glad to show you the interior. I brought
the key with me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
"But people&mdash;relatives of yours&mdash;are living
there now," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, smiling, "the house is empty.
We are thinking of putting it in shape again.
If you care to come in I can show you the quaint
old fireplaces and wainscoting&mdash;if you don't mind
dust."</p>

<p>She mounted the step lightly and, fitting the
key and unlocking the door&mdash;which he thought
he had left open&mdash;entered.</p>

<p>"Come in," she called to him in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>He crossed the threshold to her side and halted,
stunned. An empty house, silent, shadowy, desolate,
confronted him.</p>

<p>The girl beside him shook out her skirts and
glanced at her dusty gloves.</p>

<p>"A vacuum cleaner is what this place requires,"
she said. "But <i>isn't</i> it a quaint old house?"</p>

<p>He pressed his shaking hands to his closed eyes,
then forced them to open upon the terrible desolation
where <i>she</i> had stood a moment since&mdash;and
saw bare boards under foot, bare walls, cobwebs,
dust.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
The girl was tiptoeing around the four walls
examining the condition of the woodwork.</p>

<p>"It only needs electric lights and a furnace in
the cellar and some kalsomine and pretty wall paper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned to glance back at him, and stood
so, regarding him with amused curiosity&mdash;for he
had dropped on his knees in the dust, groping in
an odd blind way for a flower that had just fallen
from his coat.</p>

<p>"There are millions of them by the roadside,"
she said as he stumbled to his feet and drew the
frail blossom through his buttonhole with unsteady
fingers.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "there are other roses in the
world." Then he drew a deep, quiet breath and
smiled at her.</p>

<p>She smiled, too.</p>

<p>"This was her room," she explained, "the room
where she first met her husband, the room into
which she came a bride, the room where she died,
poor thing. Oh, I forgot that you don't know
who <i>she</i> was!"</p>

<p>"Elizabeth Tennant," he answered calmly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
"Why&mdash;how did <i>you</i> know?"</p>

<p>"God knows," he said; and bent his head, touching
the petals of the wild rose with his lips. Then
he looked up straight into her eyes&mdash;one was hazel-brown,
one hazel tinged with grey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> they left the house an hour later, walking
down the path slowly, shoulder to
shoulder, she said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown, I <i>want</i> you to like that house."</p>

<p>A sudden and subtly hideous idea glided into
his brain.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't believe in suffragettes, do you?" he
said, forcing a hollow laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, I <i>am</i> one. Didn't you know it?"</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Goodness! how you did run!
But," she added with innocent satisfaction, "I

<h2>XXIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Eugenic Revolution might fairly be
said to have begun with the ignominious
weddings of Messrs. Reginald Willett,
James Carrick, De Lancy Smith, and Alphonso
W. Green.</p>

<p>Its crisis culminated in the Long Acre riots.
But the great suffragette revolution was now coming
to its abrupt and predestined end; the reaction,
already long overdue, gathered force with
incredible rapidity and exploded from Yonkers to
Coney Island, in a furious counter-revolution.
The revolt of the Unfit was on at last.</p>

<p>Mobs of maddened spinsters paraded the streets
of the five boroughs demanding spouses. Maidens
of uncertain age and attractions who, in the hysterical
enthusiasm of the eugenic revolution, had
offered themselves the pleasures of martyrdom by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
vowing celibacy and by standing aside while physically
perfect sister suffragettes pounced upon and
married all flawless specimens of the opposite
sex, now began to demand for themselves the leavings
among the mature, thin-shanked, and bald-headed.</p>

<p>In vain their beautiful comrades attempted to
explain the eugenistic principles&mdash;to point out
that the very essence of the entire cult lay in non-reproduction
by the physically unfit, and in the
ultimate extinction of the thin, bald, and meagre
among the human race.</p>

<p>But thousands and thousands of the love-maddened
rose up and denounced the Beauty Trust,
demanded a return to the former conditions of
fair competition in the open shop of matrimony.</p>

<p>They were timidly encouraged by thousands of
middle-aged gentlemen who denied that either excessive
meagreness or baldness was hereditary;
they even dared to assert that the suffragette revolution
had been a mistake, and pointed out that
only an average of one in every hundred women
had taken the trouble to exercise her privilege at
the polls in the recent election, and that ninety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
per cent. of those who voted marked their ballots
wrong or forgot to mark them at all, or else invalidated
them by writing suggestions to the candidates
on the backs of the ballots.</p>

<p>A week of terrible confusion ensued, and, in the
very midst of it, news came from London that
Miss Pondora Bottomly, who, after throwing
bricks all day through the back windows of
Windsor Castle, had been arrested by a very thin
Scotch policeman, had suddenly seized the policeman
and married him in spite of his terrified
cries.</p>

<p>A shout of protest arose from every human man
in the civilised world; a groan of dismay burst
from every human woman. It was the beginning
of the end; the old order of things was already
in sight; men, long hidden, reappeared in public
places; wives shyly began to respond to the cautious
"good-mornings" of their long ignored husbands,
the wealthy and socially desirable but otherwise
unattractive plucked up spirits; florists,
caterers, modistes, ministers came out of seclusion
and began to prowl around the d&eacute;bris of their
ruined professions with a view to starting out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
again in business; and here and there the forgotten
art of flirting was furtively resurrected and
resumed in the awaking metropolis.</p>

<p>"Perfection," said America's greatest orator on
the floor of the Senate, "is endurable only because
unattainable. The only things on earth that make
this world interesting are its sporting chances, its
misfortunes, and its mutts!"</p>

<p>And within a month after the delivery of this
classic the American nation had resumed its normal,
haphazard aspect. The revolution, the riots
on Fifth Avenue and Long Acre, the bachelors'
St. Bartholomew were all forgotten; Tammany
Hall and the Republican State Organization
yawned, stretched, rubbed their eyes, awoke, and
sat up licking their hungry chops; the gentlemen
in charge of the Bureau of Special Privileges
opened the long-locked drawers of that piece of
furniture, and looked over the ledgers; trusts,
monopolies, systems came out of their cyclone cellars;
turf associations dredged the dump-docks
for charters, whither a feminine municipal administration
had consigned them; all-night caf&eacute;s,
dance-halls, gambling houses reopened, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
electric lights sparkled once more on painted
cheeks and tinted lips.</p>

<p>The good old days of yore were returning fast
on the heels of the retreat of woman; capital
shook hands with privilege; the prices of staples
soared; joints, dives, and hospitals were fast filling
up; jails and prisons and asylums looked forward
to full houses. It was the same old world
again&mdash;the same dear old interesting, exciting,
grafting, murdering, diseased planet, spinning
along through space&mdash;just as far as usual from
other worlds and probably so arranged in order
that other worlds might not suffer from its aroma.</p>

<p>And over it its special, man-designed god was
expected to keep watch and deal out hell or paradise
as the man-made regulations which governed
the deity and his abode required.</p>

<p>So once again the golden days of yore began;
congregations worshipped in Fifth Avenue churches
and children starved on Avenue A; splendid
hospitals were erected, palatial villas were built
in the country; and department stores paid Mamie
and Maud seven dollars a week&mdash;but competed
in vain, sometimes, with smiling and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>siderate
individuals who offered them more, including
enough to eat.</p>

<p>The world's god was back in his heaven; the
world would, therefore, go very well; and woman,
at last, was returning to her own sphere to mind
her own business&mdash;and a gifted husband, especially
created as her physical and mental lord and master
by a deity universally regarded as masculine
in sex.</p>

<h2>LEFT OVER</h2>
<h3>XXIV</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">She</span> knew so little about the metropolis
that, on her first visit, a year before, she
had asked the driver of the taxicab to
recommend a respectable hotel for a lady travelling
alone; and he had driven her to the Hotel
Aurora Borealis&mdash;that great, gay palace of Indiana
limestone and plate glass towering above
the maelstrom of Long Acre.</p>

<p>When, her business transacted, she returned to
the Westchester farm, still timid, perplexed, and
partly stunned by the glitter and noise of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
recent metropolitan abode, she determined never
again to stop at that hotel.</p>

<p>But when the time came for her to go again
the long list of hotels confused her. She did not
know one from the other; she shrank from experimenting;
and, at least, she knew something
about the Aurora Borealis and she would not feel
like an utter stranger there.</p>

<p>That was the only reason she went back there
<i>that</i> time. And the next time she came to town
that was the principal reason she returned to the
Aurora Borealis. But the next time, she made
up her mind to go elsewhere; and in the roaring
street she turned coward, and went to the only
place she knew. And the time after that she
fought a fierce little combat with herself all the
way down in the train; and, with flushed cheeks,
hating herself, ordered the cabman to take her to
the Hotel Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>But it was not until several trips after that one&mdash;on
a rainy morning in May&mdash;that she found
courage to say to the maid at the cloak-room door:</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> that young man? I always see him in
the lobby when I come here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
The maid cast an intelligent glance toward a
tall, well-built young fellow who stood pulling on
his gloves near the desk.</p>

<p>"Huh!" she sniffed; "he ain't much."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Why, he's a capper, mem."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a what?"</p>

<p>"A capper&mdash;a gambler."</p>

<p>The girl flushed scarlet. The maid handed her
a check for her rain-coat and said: "They hang
around swell hotels, they do, and pick up acquaintance
with likely looking and lonely boobs. Then
the first thing the lonely boob knows he's had a
good dinner with a new acquaintance and is strolling
into a quiet but elegant looking house in the
West Forties or Fifties." And the maid laughed,
continuing her deft offices in the dressing-room,
and the girl looked into the glass at her own crimson
cheeks and sickened eyes.</p>

<p>At luncheon he sat at a little table by a window,
alone, indolently preoccupied with a newspaper
and a fruit salad. She, across the room,
kept her troubled eyes away. Yet it was as though
she saw him&mdash;perhaps the mental embodiment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
him was the more vivid for her resolutely averted
head.</p>

<p>Every detail of his appearance was painfully
familiar to her&mdash;his dark eyes, his smooth face
which always seemed a trifle sun-tanned, the fastidious
and perfect taste of his dress in harmony
with his boyish charm and quiet distinction&mdash;and
the youth of him&mdash;the wholesome and self-possessed
youth&mdash;that seemed to her the most dreadful
thing about him in the new light of her knowledge.
For he could scarcely be twenty-five.</p>

<p>Every movement he made had long since fascinated
her; his unconscious grace had been, to her,
the unstudied assurance of a man of the world
bred to a social environment about which she knew
only through reading.</p>

<p>Never had she seen him but straightway she
began to wonder who and what exalted person in
the unknown metropolitan social circle he might
be.</p>

<p>She had often wondered, speculated; sometimes
dreamily she had endowed him with name and position&mdash;with
qualities, too&mdash;ideal qualities suggested
by his air of personal distinction&mdash;delight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>ful
qualities suggested by his dark, pleasant eyes,
and by the slight suspicion of humour lurking so
often on the edges of his smoothly shaven lips.</p>

<p>He was so clean-looking, so nice&mdash;and he had
the shoulders and the hands and the features of
good breeding! And, after all&mdash;after all, he was
a gambler!&mdash;a derelict whose sinister living was
gained by his wits; a trailer and haunter and
bleeder of men! Worse&mdash;a decoy sent out by
others!</p>

<p>She had little appetite for luncheon; he seemed
to have less. But she remembered that she had
never seen him eat very much&mdash;and never drink
anything stronger than tea.</p>

<p>"At least," she thought with a mental quiver,
"he has that to his credit."</p>

<p>The quiver surprised her; she was scarcely prepared
for any emotion concerning him except the
natural shock of disillusion and the natural pity
of a young girl for anything ignoble and hopelessly
unworthy.</p>

<p>Hopelessly? She wondered. Was it possible
that God could ever find the means of grace for
such a man? It <i>could</i> be done, of course; it were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
a sin for her to doubt it. Yet she could not see
how.</p>

<p>Still, he was young enough to have parents living
somewhere; unmarred enough to invite confidence
if he cared to. . . . And suddenly it struck
her that to invite confidence was part of his business;
his charm part of his terrible equipment.</p>

<p>She sat there breathing faster, thinking.</p>

<p>His charm was part of his equipment&mdash;an infernal
weapon! She understood it now. Long
since, innocently speculating, she had from the
very beginning and without even thinking, conceded
to him her confidence in his worthiness.
And&mdash;the man was a gambler!</p>

<p>For a few moments she hated him hotly. After
a while there was more sorrow than heat in
her hatred, more contempt for his profession than
for him. . . . And <i>somebody</i> had led him astray;
that was certain, because no man of his age&mdash;and
appearance&mdash;could have deliberately and of his
own initiative gone so dreadfully and cruelly
wrong in the world.</p>

<p>Would God pity him? Would some means be
found for his salvation? Would salvation come?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
It must; she could not doubt it&mdash;after she had
lifted her eyes once more and looked at him where
he sat immersed in his newspaper, a pleasant smile
on his lips.</p>

<p>A bar of sunlight fell across his head, striping
his shoulder; the scarlet flowers on the table were
becoming to him. And, oh! he seemed so harmless&mdash;so
delightfully decent; there where the sunlight
fell across his shoulder and spread in a
golden net across the white cloth under his elbows.</p>

<p>She rose, curiously weary; a lassitude lay
upon her as she left the room and went out into
the city about her business&mdash;which was to see her
lawyer concerning the few remaining details of her
inheritance.</p>

<p>The inheritance was the big, prosperous Westchester
farm where she lived&mdash;had always lived
with her grandfather since her parents' death. It
was turning out to be very valuable because of
the mania of the wealthy for Westchester acreage
and a revival in a hundred villages of the magnificence
of the old Patroons.</p>

<p>Outside of her own house and farm she had
land to sell to the landed and republican gentry;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
and she sold it and they bought it with an avidity
that placed her financial independence beyond
doubt.</p>

<p>All the morning she transacted business downtown
with the lawyer. In the afternoon she went
to a matin&eacute;e all by herself, and would have had
a most blissful day had it not been for the unquiet
memory of a young man who, she had learned
that morning, was fairly certain of eternal damnation.</p>

<p>That evening she went back to Westchester
absent-minded and depressed.</p>

<h2>XXV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in early June when she arrived in town
again. He was in the lobby as usual; he
lunched at the table by the window as usual.
There seemed to be nothing changed about him
except that he was a handsomer man than she had
supposed him.</p>

<p>She ate very little luncheon. As usual, he
glanced at her once&mdash;a perfectly pleasant and
inoffensive glance&mdash;and resumed his luncheon and
his newspaper. He was always quiet, always
alone. There seemed to be a curious sort of stillness
which radiated from him, laying a spell upon
his environment for a few paces on every side of
him. She had felt this; she felt it now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
Downtown her business was finally transacted;
she went to a matin&eacute;e all by herself, and found
herself staring beyond the painted curtain and the
mummers&mdash;beyond the bedizened scenery&mdash;out
into the world somewhere and into two dark, boyish
eyes that looked so pleasantly back at her.
And suddenly her own eyes filled; she bent her
head and touched them with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>No, she must never again come to the Hotel
Aurora Borealis. There were reasons. Besides,
it was no longer necessary for her to come to town
at all. She <i>must</i> not come any more. . . . And
yet, if she could only know what became of him&mdash;whether
salvation ever found him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The curtain fell; she rose and pinned on her
hat, gathered her trifles, and moved out with the
others into the afternoon sunshine of Broadway.</p>

<p>That evening she dined in her room. She had
brought no luggage. About ten o'clock the cab
was announced.</p>

<p>As she walked through the nearly deserted lobby
she looked around for him. He stood near the
door, talking to the hotel detective.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
Halting a moment to button her gloves, she
heard the detective say:</p>

<p>"Never mind the whys and whats! You fade
away! Understand?"</p>

<p>"By what authority do you forbid me entrance
to this hotel?" asked the young man coolly.</p>

<p>"Well, it's good enough for you that I tell you
to keep out!"</p>

<p>"I can not comply with your suggestion. I
have an appointment here in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Now you go along quietly," said the detective.
"We've had our eyes on you. We know
all about you. And when the hotel gets wise to
a guy like you we tip him off and he beats it!"</p>

<p>"We can discuss that to-morrow; I tell you I
have an appointment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"G'wan out o' here!" growled the detective.</p>

<p>The young man quietly fell into step beside him,
but on the sidewalk he turned on him, white and
desperate.</p>

<p>"I tell you I've <i>got</i> to keep that appointment."
He stood aside as the girl passed him, head lowered,
and halted to wait for her cab. "I tell you
I've got to go back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
"Here, you!" The detective seized his arm as
he attempted to pass; the young man wheeled and
flung him aside, and the next instant reeled back
as the detective struck him again with his billy,
knocking him halfway into the street.</p>

<p>"You damned dead-beat!" he panted, "I'll show
you!"</p>

<p>The young man stood swaying, his hands
against his head; porters, cabmen, and the detective
saw him stagger and fall heavily. And the
next moment the girl was kneeling beside him.</p>

<p>"Let him alone, lady," said somebody. "That
bum isn't hurt."</p>

<p>The "bum," in fact, was getting to his feet,
groping for some support; and the girl's arm
was offered and he leaned on it a moment, clearing
his eyes with a gloved hand. Suddenly he made
a movement so quick that she never understood
how she wrenched the short, dull-blue weapon from
his hand.</p>

<p>"Pick up your hat!" she gasped. "Do what
I tell you!"</p>

<p>He looked at her, dazed, then the blood blotted
his dark eyes again. She stooped swiftly, caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>
up his hat, and, holding tightly to his arm, opened
the other door of the taxicab.</p>

<p>"They'll kill you here," she whispered. "Come
with me. I've got to talk to you!"</p>

<p>"Lady&mdash;are you crazy?" demanded the tall
head-porter, aghast.</p>

<p>But she had got him into the cab. "Drive on,"
she said through clenched teeth. And the chauffeur
laughed and started east.</p>

<p>In the swaying cab the man beside her sat bent
over, his face in his hands, blood striping the fingers
of his gloves. With a shudder she placed the
automatic weapon on the cushion beside her and
shrank back, staring at him.</p>

<p>But his senses seemed to be returning, for presently
he sat up, found his handkerchief, staunched
the rather insignificant abrasion, and settled back
into his corner. Without looking at her he said:</p>

<p>"Would you mind if I thank you? You have
been very kind."</p>

<p>She could not utter a word.</p>

<p>Presently he turned; and as he looked at her
for the first time a faint flicker of humour seemed
to touch his eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
"Where are we going&mdash;if you don't mind?" he
said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Then the breathless words came, haltingly.</p>

<p>"I've got to tell you something; I've <i>got</i> to!
I can't stand aside&mdash;I <i>can't</i> pass by on the other
side!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, smiling, "but Lazarus
is all right now."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;something else!" Her voice fell to
a whisper. "I <i>must</i> speak!"</p>

<p>He looked pleasantly perplexed, smiling.</p>

<p>"Is there anything&mdash;except a broken head&mdash;that
could possibly permit me the opportunity of
listening to you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;have seen you before."</p>

<p>"And I you."</p>

<p>She leaned against her window, head resting on
her hand, her heart a chaos.</p>

<p>"Where are you going when&mdash;when I leave
you?" she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Where?" She turned to look at him. "Are
you going back to that hotel?" And, as he made
no reply: "Do you wish to become a murderer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
too?" she said tremulously. "I have your pistol.
I ask you not to go back there."</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "No, I won't go back. . . . Where
is the pistol?"</p>

<p>"You shall not have it."</p>

<p>"I think perhaps it would be safer with me."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I&mdash;I ask you to keep away from that
man!" She grew unconsciously dramatic. "I ask
you&mdash;if you have any memory which you hold
sacred&mdash;to promise me on that memory not to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't shoot him," he said, watching her curiously.
"Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Then I promise&mdash;on my most sacred memory&mdash;the
memory of a young girl who saved me from
committing&mdash;what I meant to do. . . . And I
thank her very deeply."</p>

<p>She said: "I <i>did</i> save you from&mdash;<i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;God knows." He himself was trembling
a little; his face had turned very white.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;" she forced her courage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>&mdash;lifted
her frightened eyes, braving mockery and
misconstruction&mdash;"then&mdash;is there a chance of my&mdash;helping
you&mdash;further?"</p>

<p>For a moment her flushed face and timid question
perplexed him; then the quick blood reddened
his face, and he stared at her in silence.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't help it," she faltered. "I believe
in you&mdash;and in&mdash;salvation. . . . Please don't say
anything to&mdash;hurt me."</p>

<p>"No," he said, still staring, "no, of course not.
And&mdash;and thank you. You are very kind. . . . You
are <i>very</i> kind. . . . I suppose you heard
somebody say&mdash;what I am."</p>

<p>"Yes. . . . But that was long ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, you knew&mdash;you have known&mdash;for some
time?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He sat thinking for a while.</p>

<p>Presently they both noticed that the cab had
stopped&mdash;had probably been standing for some
time in front of the station; and that several red-capped
porters were watching them.</p>

<p>"My name is Lily Hollis," she said, "and I live
at Whitebrook Farm, Westchester. . . . I am not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
coming to New York again&mdash;and never again to
that hotel. . . . But I would like to talk to you&mdash;a
little."</p>

<p>He thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Do you want a gambler to call on you, Miss
Hollis?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"Then he will do it. When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his marred young
face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "to-morrow."</p>

<p>He looked up and met her eyes, smiled, opened
the door, and stepped to the sidewalk. Then he
went with her to her train. She turned at the
gates and held out her hand to him; and, hat in
hand, he bent his battered head and touched her
gloves with twitching lips.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She said, wistfully: "May I trust in you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Tell me that you trust me."</p>

<p>"I trust you," she said; and laid the pistol in
his hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
His face altered subtly. "I did not mean in
that way," he said.</p>

<p>"How could I trust you more?"</p>

<p>"With&mdash;yourself."</p>

<p>"That is a&mdash;lesser trust," she said faintly. "It
is for you that I have been afraid."</p>

<p>He saw the colour deepen in her cheeks, looked,
bit his lip in silence.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" she said under her breath.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good-bye till then."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<h2>XXVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day he didn't appear, but a letter
did.</p>

<p>"I merely lied to you," he wrote.
"All gamblers are liars. You should have passed
by on the other side."</p>

<p>Yes, that is what she should have done; she
realised it now alone there in the sunny parlour
with his letter.</p>

<p>There was no chance for him; or, if there was,
she had not been chosen as the instrument of his
salvation.</p>

<p>Slowly she turned her head and looked around
her at her preparations&mdash;the pitiful little preparations
for him&mdash;the childish stage setting for
the scene of his salvation.</p>

<p>The spotless parlour had been re-dusted,
cleaned, rubbed to its old-time polish. Bible and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[<a href="./images/281.png">281</a>]</span>
prayer-book on the mahogany centre-table had
been arranged and re-arranged so many times that
she no longer knew whether or not her art concealed
art, and was innocently fearful that he
might suspect the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and fight shy of
her preparations for his regeneration.</p>

<p>Again and again she had re-arranged the flowers
and books and rumpled the un-read morning
newspaper to give to the scene a careless and
casual every-day allure; again and again she
had straightened the rugs, then tried them in
less symmetrical fashion. She let the kitten in
to give a more home-like air to the room,
but it squalled to go out, and she had to release
it.</p>

<p>Also, from the best spare room she had brought
Holman Hunt's "Shadow of the Cross"&mdash;and it
had taxed her slender strength to hang it in place
of the old French mezzotint of Bacchus and
Ariadne.</p>

<p>But the most difficult task was to disseminate
among the stiff pieces of furniture and the four
duplicate sofa cushions an atmosphere of pleasant
and casual disorder&mdash;as though guests had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
left them where they were&mdash;as though the rigid
chairs were accustomed to much and intimate
usage.</p>

<p>But the effect troubled her; every formal bit
of furniture seemed to be arranged as for an ambuscade;
the cushions on the carved sofa sat in
a row, like dwarfs waiting; the secretary watched,
every diamond pane a glittering eye. And on
the wall the four portraits of her parents and
grand-parents were behaving strangely, for she
seemed never to be out of range of their unwinking
painted eyes.</p>

<p>From other rooms she had brought in ornaments,
books, little odds and ends&mdash;and the unaccustomed
concentration of household gods
caused her much doubt and uncertainty, so fearful
was she that his wise dark eyes might smilingly
detect her effort.</p>

<p>There had been much to do in the short time
pending his arrival&mdash;the gravel path to be raked,
the lawn to be rolled and cut, the carefully weeded
flower beds to be searched for the tiniest spear
of green which did not belong there, the veranda
to be swept again, and all the potted plants to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>
be re-arranged and the dead leaves and blossoms
to be removed.</p>

<p>Then there were great sheafs of iris to gather;
and that, and the cutting of peonies and June
roses, were matters to go about with thought and
discretion, so that no unsightly spaces in bloom
and foliage should be apparent to those dark, wise
eyes of his that had looked on so many things in
life&mdash;so many, many things of which she knew
nothing.</p>

<p>Also she was to offer him tea; and the baking
of old-fashioned biscuits and sweets was a matter
for prayerful consideration. And Hetty, the
hired girl, had spent all the morning on her grand-mother's
silver, and William Pillsbury, executor
of chores, had washed the doorstep and polished
the windows and swept the maple-pods and poplar
silk from the roof-gutters, and was now down on
his knees with shears, trimming the grass under
the picket-fence.</p>

<p>And <i>he</i> was not coming after all. He was never
coming.</p>

<p>For a little while she failed to realise it; there
was a numb sensation in her breast, a dull confu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>sion
in her mind. She sat alone in the parlour,
in her pretty new gown, looking straight ahead
of her, seeing nothing&mdash;not even his letter in her
hand.</p>

<p>And she sat there for a long while; the numbness
became painful; the tension a dull endurance.
Fatigue came, too; she rested her head wearily on
the back of the chair and closed her eyes. But
the tall clocks ticking slowly became unendurable&mdash;and
the odour of the roses hurt her.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through and through her shot a pang
of fright; she had just remembered that she had
given him back his pistol.</p>

<p>On her feet now, startled as though listening,
she stood, lips slightly parted, and the soft colour
gone from them. Then she went to the window
and looked down the road; and came back to stand
by the centre-table, her clasped hands resting on
the Bible.</p>

<p>For a while fear had its way with her; the silent
shock of it whitened her face and left her
with fair head bowed above her clasped hands.</p>

<p>Once or twice she opened the Bible and tried to
understand, choosing what she cared for most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[<a href="./images/285.png">285</a>]</span>&mdash;reading
of Lazarus, too. And she read about
miracles&mdash;those symbolic superfluities attributed
to a life which in itself was the greatest of all
miracles.</p>

<p>And ever through the word of God glittered
the memory of the pistol till fear made her faint,
and she rose, her hands against her breast, and
walked unsteadily out under the trees.</p>

<p>A bird or two had begun its sunset carol; the
tree-trunks were stained with the level crimson
light. Far away her gaze rested on the blue hills.
Beyond them lay the accursed city.</p>

<p>The dull reiteration in her brain throbbed on
unceasingly; she had given him his pistol; he had
lied to her; she had trusted him; he had lied;
and the accursed city lay beyond those hills&mdash;and
he was there&mdash;with his pistol; and he had lied
to her&mdash;lied! lied! God help them both!</p>

<p>Across her clover fields the ruddy sunlight lay
in broad undulating bands, gilding blossom and
curling trefoil. On every side of her the farm
stretched away over a rolling country set with
woods; sweet came the freshening air from the
hills; she heard her collie barking at the cattle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
along the pasture brook; a robin carolled loudly
from the orchard; orioles answered; gusts of twittering
martins swept and soared and circled the
chimneys.</p>

<p>Erect, anguished hands clenched, she stood
there, wide eyes seeing nothing, and in her shrinking
ears only the terrible reiteration of her growing
fears.</p>

<p>Then the level sun struck her body with a bar
of light; all the world around her smouldered rose
and crimson. But after a little the shadows fell
through the fading light; and she turned her head,
shivering, and went back to the house&mdash;back to
the room she had prepared for him, and sat there
watching the shapes of dusk invade it; the vague
grey ghosts that came crawling from corners and
alcoves to gather at her feet and wait and wait
there with her for him who would never come into
her life again.</p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Miss lily?</span>"</p>

<p>She lifted her head from the sofa
cushion in the dark, dazzled by the
sudden lamp-light.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, averting her face.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman says he'd like to see
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl turned, still dully confused; then, rigid,
sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>"<i>Who?</i>"</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;said you don't know his name.
Shall I show him in?"</p>

<p>She managed to nod; her heart was beating so
violently that she pressed her hand over it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
He saw her sitting that way when he entered.</p>

<p>She did not rise; pain and happiness, mingled,
confusing her for a moment; and he was already
seated near her, looking at her with an intentness
almost expressionless.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "what the honour of a gambler
is worth. I have lied to you twice already."</p>

<p>His words brought her to her senses. She rose
with an effort and, as he stood up, she gave him
her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't think me rude," she said. "I was resting&mdash;not
expecting you&mdash;and the lamp and&mdash;your
coming&mdash;confused me."</p>

<p>"You were not expecting me," he said, retaining
her hand an instant. Then she withdrew it; they
seated themselves.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, "perhaps I was expecting
you&mdash;and didn't realise it."</p>

<p>"Had you thought&mdash;much about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>Then it seemed as though something sealed her
lips, and that nothing could ever again unseal
them. All that she had to say to him vanished
from her mind; she could not recall a single phrase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
she had prepared to lead up to all she must somehow
say to him.</p>

<p>He talked quietly to her for a while about nothing
in particular. Once she saw him turn and look
around the room; and a moment afterward he
spoke of the old-time charm of the place and the
pretty setting such a room made for the old-fashioned
flowers.</p>

<p>He spoke about gardens as though he had
known many; he spoke of trees and of land and
of stock; and, as he spoke in his pleasant, grave
young voice, he noticed the portraits on the wall;
and he spoke of pictures as though he had known
many, and he spoke of foreign cities, and of old-world
scenes. And she listened in silence and in
such content that the happiness of it seemed
to invade her utterly and leave her physically
numb.</p>

<p>From time to time his dark eyes wandered from
her to the objects in the room; they rested for
a moment on the centre-table with its Book, lingered,
passed on. For a little while he did not
look at her&mdash;as though first it were necessary to
come to a conclusion. Whatever the conclusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
might have been, it seemed to make his eyes and
mouth alternately grave and amused&mdash;but only
very faintly amused&mdash;as though the subject he
was considering held him closely attentive.</p>

<p>And at last he looked up at her, gently, not all
the curiosity yet quenched.</p>

<p>"You are kind enough to wish to know about
me; and too well bred to ask&mdash;now that the time
is come. Shall I speak of myself?"</p>

<p>Her voiceless lips found a word.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;<i>It</i> began in college&mdash;after my uncle
died and left nothing for me to go on with. . . .
I worked my way through&mdash;by my wits. . . . Up
to that time it was only luck and card-sense&mdash;and
luck again&mdash;the ability to hold the best cards at
the best time&mdash;hold them honestly, I mean. It
happens&mdash;I don't know why or what laws govern
it. Some men hold them&mdash;always hold them&mdash;with
intervals of bad fortune&mdash;but only intervals."</p>

<p>He gazed thoughtfully at the rag carpet, passed
a well-shaped hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the truth. . . . And so, Fortune
linked arms with me . . . and I drifted into it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>&mdash;gradually&mdash;not
all at once . . . lower&mdash;always a
little lower&mdash;until&mdash;what <i>you</i> saw occurred."</p>

<p>She would not meet his eyes, perhaps with an
idea of sparing him.</p>

<p>He said: "You know nothing of such things,
of course. . . . I am&mdash;on a commission basis for
doing what&mdash;they threw me out of that hotel for
doing. . . . Of course, a man can fall lower&mdash;but
not much lower. . . . The business from
which I receive commissions is not honest&mdash;a
square game, as they say. Some games may be
square for a while; no games are perfectly square
all the time. . . . I have heard of honest gamblers;
I never saw one. . . . There may be some;
but I'm afraid they're like good Indians. . . .
And that is the way in which Life and I are situated."</p>

<p>After a while she managed to look at him.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me&mdash;are you&mdash;your circumstances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not in want," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Then it is not&mdash;not necessity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. It is easier and more interesting than
for me to earn a decent living."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
"Is that the only reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Have you no&mdash;regrets?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. . . . I am not immune to shame. . . .
I wonder whether you know what it cost me
to come here."</p>

<p>A dull flush mounted to his forehead, but he
faced her steadily enough.</p>

<p>"You saw me kicked out of a hotel by an Irish
servant because I was not fit to be tolerated among
reputable people. . . . And you did not pass by
on the other side. . . . Under your clear eyes my
spirit died a thousand shameful deaths while I
went with you to your destination. . . . The contempt
of the whole world burnt me; and your
compassion drove every flame into me&mdash;&mdash;" He
checked himself, swallowed, forced a smile, and
went on in his low, pleasant voice: "I am afraid
I have been dramatic. . . . All I meant to say is
that my humiliation, witnessed by you, is a heavier
price to pay&mdash;a more painful reckoning with
Fate, than I had really ever looked for."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I had no contempt for you," she faltered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
"You could not escape it; but it is kind of you
to say that."</p>

<p>"You don't understand. I had no contempt.
I was&mdash;it&mdash;the dread of harm to you&mdash;frightened
me. . . . And afterward I was only so sorry for
you&mdash;and wanted to&mdash;to help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He nodded. "The larger charity," he said.
"You may read all about it there in that Bible,
but&mdash;the world takes it out in reading about it. . . .
I do not mean to speak bitterly. . . . There
is nothing wrong with me as far as the world
goes&mdash;I mean <i>my</i> world. . . . Only&mdash;in the other
and real world there is&mdash;you. . . . You, who did
not pass by on the other side; and to whom the
Scriptures there are merely the manual which you
practice&mdash;for the sake of Christ."</p>

<p>"You think me better&mdash;far better than I am."</p>

<p>"I know what you are. I know what it cost
you to even let me lean on you, there in the glare
of the electric light&mdash;there where men stood leering
and sneering and misjudging you!&mdash;and my
blood on your pretty gown&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I did not think&mdash;care about that&mdash;or the
men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
"You cared about them. It is a growing torture
to you. Even in the generous flush of mercy
you thought of it; you said you would never go
back to that hotel. I knew why you said it. I
knew what, even then, you suffered&mdash;what of fear
and shame and outraged modesty. I know what
you stood for, there in the street with a half-senseless
crook hanging to your arm&mdash;tugging for a
weapon which would have sent two more mongrels
to hell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall not say that!" she cried, white and
trembling. "You did not know what you were
doing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted: "'For they know not what
they do.' . . . You are right. . . . We don't
really know, any of us. But few, except such as
you, believe it&mdash;few except such as you&mdash;and the
Master who taught you. . . . And that is all, I
think. . . . I can't thank you; I can't even try. . . .
It is too close to melodrama now&mdash;not on
your side, dear little lady!"</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;going?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
"Where?"</p>

<p>He turned unconsciously and looked through
the windows into the southern darkness.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;want you to stay," she said.</p>

<p>He turned and bent toward her with his youthful
and engaging manner.</p>

<p>"It is sweet and good of you; but you know
it is best that I go."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;it might be that some of your friends
would know me. . . . It is for your sake I am
going."</p>

<p>"I wish you to stay."</p>

<p>"I know it. It makes me wonderfully happy."</p>

<p>"<i>Won't</i> you?"</p>

<p>"I must not."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do in the city?"</p>

<p>There was a silence; then: "The <i>same</i>?" she
faltered.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"What else is there?"</p>

<p>"Everything. . . . And I&mdash;ask it of you."</p>

<p>He looked at her with troubled eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
"I'm afraid you don't know what you are asking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do know! I ask&mdash;your soul of God!"</p>

<p>For a long while he stood there as though turned
to stone. Then, as though rousing from a dream,
he walked slowly to the window, looked long into
the south. At last he turned.</p>

<p>She sat on the edge of the sofa, her face in her
hands, deathly silent, waiting.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she whispered, not looking up as
he bent over her.</p>

<p>"About that matter of a stray soul?" he said
pleasantly. "It's all right&mdash;if you care to&mdash;bother
with it. . . ."</p>

<p>Her hands dropped, and when she looked up
he saw the tears standing in her grey eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" she asked, trembling.</p>

<p>"God knows what I mean," he said unsteadily;
"and I shall never know unless you tell me."</p>

<p>And he sat down beside her, resting his elbows
on his knees and his head between his hands, wondering
what he could do with life and with the
young soul already in his dark keeping. And, after
a while, the anxiety of responsibility, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
totally new, wearied him; perplexed, he lifted his
head, seeking her eyes; and saw the compassion in
her face and the slow smile trembling on her lips.
And suddenly he understood which of them was
better fitted for a keeper of souls.</p>

<p>"Will you be patient?" he said.</p>

<p>"Can you ask?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, looking vacantly at the
lamp-light.</p>

<p>"Because I've gone all wrong somehow . . . since
I was a boy. . . . You <i>will</i> be patient with
me&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>
